To compile code with debug information using gcc, include -g flag.

To run gdb,
  gdb {executable}

gdb Commands
------------

help - displays help catgegories
help {category} - displays help for a given category

l[ist] [start-line,end-line] - prints lines around current position
b[reak] {line-number}
b[reak] {scope-qualified-method-name}
  - ex. COS::MW::Discovery::unregisterAsyncQueries
  - ex. COS::MW::Subscriber::~Subscriber() - note the parens!
  - supports tab completion of method names!
inf[o] b[reak] - lists breakpoints
disable {breakpoint-number} - disables a breakpoint
d[elete] {breakpoint-number} - deletes a breakpoint
  
r[un] - runs from beginning
c[ont] - continues from current location

n[ext] - executes current line, but doesn't step in
s[tep] - executes current line and steps in if it's a method call
Enter key - repeats last command (useful with next and step)

ins[pect] {variable} - displays value of a variable

bt - displays backtrace
up - moves up in the stack frame so calling code can be examined
down - moves down in the stack frame
frame # - moves to a specified stack frame

attach {pid} - to attach to a running process
  - after this it's common to use "bt" to get a back trace
    in order to find out where the process is in the code

q[uit] - exits the debugger

Other Notes
-----------
- can set breakpoints in .gdbinit file in the current directory
  so they are reused across sessions
- to examine a core file in gdb
  * build the application with -g for debugging
  * enter "ulimit -c unlimited" (so large core files can be produced)
  * run the application
  * enter "gdb {executable-file} {core-file}"
  * enter "bt" to get a backtrace

ddd Notes
---------

This is a GUI for gdb.

To install it,
  download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd
  gunzip it
  tar xf it
  rm the .tar file
  cd ddd-3.3.11
  ./configure
  make
  add the following lines to .bashrc
    export DDD_HOME=/home/mvolkmann/ddd/ddd-3.3.11
    export PATH=$PATH:$DDD_HOME/ddd

To run it, just enter "ddd".

Select File...Open Program, then enter path to executable to be debugged.

To see line numbers, select Source...Display Line Numbers or press alt-n.

You can enter gdb commands in the GDB Console which is the bottom pane.
You can also select commands from the floating palette or the Commands menu.

To resize the panes, drag the small boxes on the right side of the dividers.

To inspect variables graphically,
- open the "Data Window" by selecting View...Data Window
- double-click a variable in the Source Window to view it graphically
- to see the value of a string, open _M_dataplus and then _M_p
- double-click a property in the Data Window to expand it
- double-click a propery again to collapse it
