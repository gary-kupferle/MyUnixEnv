Ruby on Rails Notes

- Installing
  * sudo gem install rails -y

- Behaviour-driven Development
  * http://behaviour-driven.org/
  * evolution of test-driven development and
    acceptance test-driven planning
  * supported by RSpec Ruby library
    - http://rspec.rubyforge.org
    - works with Rails
    - install with "gem install rspec"?
    - run with "spec {name}_spec.rb [--format {specdoc|html|...}]"
    - has built-in mocks
      * http://respec.rubyforge.org/docmentation/mocks/
    - has built-in stubs
      * http://respec.rubyforge.org/docmentation/mocks/stubs.html
    - status of a test can be passing, failing or not implemented
  * three core principles
    - business and technology should refer to the same system in the same way
    - any system should have an identified, verifiable value to the business
    - up-front analysis, design and planning all have a diminishing return
  * advantages
    - focuses on the behaviour you want
    - common language for devlopers, business, QA
    - many types of documentation
      * behaviour text
      * specs illustrate use of the API in context of a behaviour
      * errors indicate what behaviour failed
        in addition to the failure and stack trace

- Zentest
  * http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest
  * a collection of testing utilities
  * autotest
    - automatically reruns tests when related code is modified
  * gem install zentest

- Typical order of development
  * model then controller then view
