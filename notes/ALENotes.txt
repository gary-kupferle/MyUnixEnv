ALE Notes

- a Vim plugin for Vim 8 and above
  * uses job control functions introduced in Vim 8
- stands for "Asynchronous Linting Environment"
  * runs asynchrously after every change without requiring a save
- alternative to Syntastic
  * only runs on saves and isn't asynchronous
- at https://github.com/w0rp/ale
  * describes installation steps and configuration options
  * provides a list of supported syntaxes and linters
- supports many linting tools for many syntaxes/languages
  * by default uses all supported linting tools that are installed
- tool configuration files
  * it seems that if tool configuration files are modified,
    Vim must be restarted in order to load the changes
- JavaScript supported linters include
  eslint, jscs, jshint, and flow
  * npm install -g eslint
  * npm install -g flow-bin
    - only checks files with // @flow comment at top
    - may take about 30 seconds for the first Flow check
      if the flow server isn't already running
  * potential eslint issue
    - if eslint is installed locally in the current project,
      that version of eslint will be used instead of the global one
    - if the versions differ, the eslint configuration file may not
      be compatiable because it may configure rules that aren't known
    - the best way to resolve this is to update both to the latest version
- HTML supported linters include
  tidy and HTMLHint
  * npm install -g tidy-html5
- CSS supported linters include
  csslint and stylelint
  * npm install -g csslint
- JSON supported linters include
  jsonlint
  * npm install -g jsonlint
- indicates errors with characters in the gutter
  * can use emojis
- move cursor to a line with an error or warning indicator
  to see associated message in status bar
