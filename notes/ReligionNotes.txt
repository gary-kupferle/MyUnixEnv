Religion Notes

Source of doubts
- college math and science courses where we are taught not to say something
  is true until it is proven; it's viewed as a character flaw to do otherwise
- lack of desire to listen to Christian radio (friend Rick Reichert)

Questions about the Bible
- Why would God take a rib from Adam in order to create Eve?
  Bones are important?  None were required to create Adam.
- Where do dinosaurs fit in?
- Why did God desire animal sacrifices in the Old Testament?
- Was it reasonable to ask Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac in Genesis?
- Did God really approve of so called holy wars?
- Are there any Old Testament prophecies that came to pass and are not
  merely vague references to future events?

General questions
- What is the purpose of prayer? Why pray for God to do his will?
- Is it necessary to hold conservative political viewpoints
  to fit in at church?
- Why does God desire for us to worship him now and for eternity?
- Why is going to heaven appealing? Is it just to avoid hell?
- Salvation seems like a game set up by God where we are presented with
  minimal proof of his existence and we either accept it and get rewarded by
  being able to worship him forever or we reject it and are tortured forever.
  It's difficult to understand why God set up a system like this.
- Why doesn't God provide more proof of his existence?
  Is it part of the game?
- Why should we be convinced that Christianity is more correct than
  so-called cults?
- Nature is a strong indicator that there must be a creator, but how do we
  go from that to believing that the creator is the god of the Bible?
- Why do people feel thankful toward God after they have lived through a
  disaster where they experience great loss but are still alive?
