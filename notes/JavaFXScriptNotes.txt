- Things I like about it
  * limited number of primitive types
    - Boolean, String, Number, Integer (may go away)
  * use of cardinality characters ?, * and + in attribute declarations
    - defines sequences (implemented like Java ArrayList)
  * object literal syntax
  * range syntax
  * open classes like Ruby
    - can add attributes, functions and operations
  * for loop supports SQL-like syntax (where clause)
  * can obtain a sequence of indexes in another sequence
    whose values meet some criteria
    - example
      var scores = [98, 103, 72, 119]
      var indexes = scores[. > 100]
      // returns [1, 3] which are indexes in the scores sequence
  * SQL-like syntax for obtaining a sequence of values computed from
    one or more other sequences (similar to XQuery)
  * SQL-like syntax for inserting and deleting sequence elements
  * triggers which define blocks of code to be executed
    when certain events occur
    - examples
      * creating a new instance of a given class
      * changing the value of a given attribute in an instance
      * changing the value of an element in a given sequence
      * inserting a new element into a given sequence
      * deleting an element from a given sequence
  * reflection
    - can learn about the attributes, functions and operations of a class
      at run-time
  * bind operator
    - can define an instance attribute so its value is computed
      based on the current values of other attributes
  * GUI widget set that wraps Swing widgets
  * GUI widget set that wraps the Java 2D API
    - transformations are composable
  * animation with the "dur" operator
  * deployment options
    - JavaFX Script application
    - Java application
    - Java Web Start
    - Java applet
    - use JSR 223 "Scripting for the Java Platform"

- Questionable things
  - distinction between functions and operations
    * functions
      -  defined by a set of declarations followed by one return statement
      - cannot have side effects
    * operations
      - defined by a sequence of statements
      - can have side effects
  - no hash collection type?
  - weird use of "var:" in object literals to select a variable name
    to be used like the Java "this" keyword
    * but the "this" keyword is supported in operations

- Threads
  * can't explicitly control threads
  * by default everything happens on the AWT event thread
  * to do work on a different thread, put code in a do statement
    - like Swing's invokeLater
