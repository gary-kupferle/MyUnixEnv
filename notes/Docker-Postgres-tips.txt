To see what's in the database from the command line:

- Open a bash shell inside the running Docker container with
  docker exec -it capacity-api-postgres /bin/bash
- Start Postgres interactive mode with
  psql -U$POSTGRES_USER -d$POSTGRES_DB
- To list the tables in the database, enter \d
- To list the columns in a table, enter \d {table-name}
- Enter a SQL query. For example, select * from asset_type;
- Exit psql interactive mode by pressing ctrl-d.
- Exit the container shell by entering "exit" or pressing ctrl-d.
