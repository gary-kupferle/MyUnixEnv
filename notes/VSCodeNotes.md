# VS Code Notes

Keyboard shortcuts in these notes show the Windows version
followed by the macOS version in parentheses.

## Overview

* code editor from Microsoft
* implemented with the Electron framework
* mostly implemented in TypeScript
* mostly open source; see <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode>

## To install

* browse <https://code.visualstudio.com/https://code.visualstudio.com/>

## Basics

* can reopen recently edited files with File...Open Recent
* to open the Command Palette, press ctrl-P (cmd-P)
* to edit a file from a terminal, code {file-name}
  * will launch VS Code if not already running
  * otherwise will use existing VS Code session
* reopens last set of tabs when restarted

## Auto-Closing Brackets

* by default matching delimiters are entered automatically
* for example, typing { results in {} with the cursor between them
* to disable this, add the following to settings

```text
"editor.autoClosingBrackets": false,
```

## Auto Close Tag extension

* automatically adds closing tag when an opening tag is entered
* ex. entering `<span>` adds `</span>` after the cursor
* not good in JavaScript files that use generics or JSX with empty tags

## Auto Rename Tag extension

* automatically renames other side of tag when one is renamed
* ex. can change "header" to "footer" in either `<header>` or `</header>`

## Code Folding

* works in many kinds of source files including
  JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Markdown
  * really nice for focusing work on specific sections
    in a Markdown file!
* to fold all blocks in the current editor,
  open Command Palette and enter "Fold All"
  * recommended for Markdown files
* to unfold all blocks in the current editor,
  open Command Palette and enter "Unfold All"
* to fold a specific block of code, click icon
  with minus in box to the left of the code
* to open a fold, click icon with plus in box
* to fold all block comments in the current editor,
  open Command Palette and enter "Fold All Block Comments"

## Code Hints

* look for light bulb icon or an ellipsis below code
* hover over to see hint

## Code Outline extension

* adds a left nav toggle button that displays a code outline
  in place of the EXPLORER when toggled on
* lists all the functions, classes, and methods defined
  in the current editor tab
* clicking a name scrolls to it in the editor tab

## Color Themes

* default is "Dark+"
* to change theme
  * click gear in lower-left and select "Color Theme"
    or select Code...Preferences...Color Theme
    and select one from the menu
  * use up and down arrow keys to navigate the list of themes
  * will update to show the theme colors as you navigate
  * will be stored in settings as "workbench.colorTheme"
* to customize colors for nearly everying in the editor, see
  <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference>
* to customize colors for specific syntax elements (tokens)
  in editor windows
  * modify settings
  * add "editor.tokenColorCustomizations" property
    where the value is an object with these keys:
    comments, functions, keywords, numbers,
    strings, types, and variables
  * each property has a color value that
    must be specified as a hex string
    * ex. "#ff00ff"
    * hover over these strings to get a color picker popup
  * for additional syntax elements, add "textMateRules" property
    * ex. to set colors of HTML tags and attributes
      ```json
      "textMateRules": [
        {
          "name": "Tags",
          "scope": "entity.name.tag",
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#9ADCF8"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Attributes",
          "scope": "entity.other.attribute-name",
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#539BD9"
          }
        },
      ]
      ```
  * for more examples of textMateRules see

## Sidebar

* where the EXPLORER, Search, Source Control, Debug, and Extensions panels are displayed

  * click gear in lower-left
  * select "User Snippets"
  * select an existing snippets .json file,
    the language to which it will apply (creates {language}.json file),
