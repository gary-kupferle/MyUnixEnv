Semantic Web Notes

- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web

- "Humans are capable of using the Web to carry out tasks such as
  finding the Finnish word for "monkey", reserving a library book,
  and searching for a low price for a DVD.
  However, a computer cannot accomplish the same tasks
  without human direction because web pages are
  designed to be read by people, not machines.
  The semantic web is a vision of information
  that is understandable by computers,
  so that they can perform more of the tedious work involved in
  finding, sharing, and combining information on the web."

- an extension of the World Wide Web in which the semantics
  of information and services on the web is defined

- releated specifications include Resource Description Framework (RDF),
  various interchnage formats and notations such as
  RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL)

- Semantic HTML adds information about the intention of data
  in an HTML document.

- Microformats are an attempt to extend HTML to with markup
  that allows software to determine the meaning of data.
  * example from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat#Example
    <div class="vcard">
      <div class="fn">Joe Doe</div>
      <div class="org">The Example Company</div>
      <div class="tel">604-555-1234</div>
      <a class="url" href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
    </div>
  * some specific microformats have been defined
    - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat#Specific_microformats

- While OCI doesn't have specific experience with
  semantic web applications, we do have significant experience with
  related technologies that will provide value.  These include:
  * HTML
    - necessary as the basis of microformats
  * XML
    - necessary to extend HTML into a particular microformat
  * XML Schema
    - one way to describe the requirements
      of a particular microformat
  * XSLT to transform one XML format to another
    - one way to transform generic HTML to a microformat
  * XML parsers
    - to parse and create XML-based data 
    - event-based (SAX), document object model-based (DOM)
      and pull-parser-based (ex. Woodstox)
    - OCI created an open-source library (WAX)
      for extremely efficient XML generation
      * provides high performance and minimal memory usage
  * REST
    - a populate way to implement services that
      receive and/or send semantic web data
