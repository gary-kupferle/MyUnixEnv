# Google Cloud Platform Notes

- browse cloud.google.com
- press "GO TO CONSOLE" button
- click dropdown in upper-left to create a new project or select an existing one
  - using "node-rest-demo"
- scroll down to the "Getting Started" section
- click "Enable APIs"
- scroll to "Google Cloud SQL" and click "Enable"
- browse <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/>
- click a package link to download "Cloud Tools" for your platform
- unzip the downloaded zip file
- open a terminal window
- cd to the google-cloud-sdk directory
- enter `./install.sh`
- enter `./bin/gcloud init`
  - will ask lots of questions
- from the dashboard hamburger menu in the upper-left, select "SQL"
- click "CREATE INSTANCE"
- press "Choose MySQL" or "Choose PostgreSQL"
- select a configuration
- enter an instance id (a.k.a. instance name) and remember it
  - mine is `node-rest-demo-db`
- enter a password and remember it
  - mine is `password`
- select a region
- press "CREATE" button
  - takes around 5 minutes!
- to see information about the instance
  - `gcloud sql instances describe {instance-id}`
  - see `connectName` in this output
    - mine is `node-rest-demo:us-central1:node-rest-demo-db`
- set the default password for the Cloud SQL instance
  - `gcloud sql users set-password postgres no-host --instance {instance-id} --password {password}`
- granting access to other projects
  - if your App Engine application and Cloud SQL instance are in different projects,
    you must use a service account to allow you application to access it
  - otherwise no extra steps are needed
- to test the application locally
  - install the Cloud SQL Proxy
    - browse <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/using-cloud-sql-postgres>
    - scroll to "Install the Cloud SQL proxy"
    - click the tab for your platform
    - copy the command to download the software
    - paste it in a terminal
    - follow the platform-specific instructions
      - for macOS it is `chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy`
  - start the Cloud SQL Proxy
    - this allows accessing the cloud database from a locally running app
    - enter `./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=node-rest-demo:us-central1:node-rest-demo-db=tcp:5432`
    - I could not get this to work! I get
      "google: could not find default credentials"
- set up the Cloud SQL Instance

  - create a user
    - `gcloud sql users create mvolkmann no-host --instance node-rest-demo-db`
    - I could not get this to work! I get
      "gcloud sql users create mvolkmann no-host --instance node-rest-demo-db"

STOPPED HERE

- to deploy the current project to the app server
  cd server
  copy src/secrets.json to build directory # AUTOMATE IN PACKAGE.JSON!
  copy src/actions.json to build directory # AUTOMATE IN PACKAGE.JSON!
  update app.yaml (one-time)
  npm install (one-time and after package version updates)

  - `npm run build`
  - `gcloud app deploy`
    - took eight minutes which is totally ridiculous!!!
    - this was not even the initial deploy!
  - URL will be <https://{project-id}.appspot.com>
    - Does this imply that project-ids must be globally unique
      or does it choose a different domain if yours conflicts
      with the project of another user?

- to hit the app
  - get the URL by running `gcloud app browse`
  - send REST requests, perhaps using Postman
