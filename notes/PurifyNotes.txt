Purify Notes
------------

Some of this may be Boeing/J-UCAS-specific.

- Add the following to a Makefile.
  PURIFY_BIN = {exe-name}.purify
  purify: ${PURIFY_BIN)
  $(PURIFY_BIN): $(BIN)
    purify $(CXX) $(LIBPATHS) $(LDFLAGS) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $(OBJ) $(LDLIBS) $(LIBS)
  For example, {exe-name} could be client or server.

- Warning!
  If you regenerate makefiles using MPC, these changes will be lost!

- Run "make -f {name-of-makefile} purify
  For example,
  make -f Makefile.server purify
  make -f Makefile.client purify
  You created a makepurify script to do both of these.

- Run "{exe-name}.purify
  For example,
  server.purify
  client.purify
