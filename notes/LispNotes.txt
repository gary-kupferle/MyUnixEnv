Lisp Notes

Lisp1
- has a single namespace that serves a dual role
  as the function namespace and value namespace
- the functional position of a form and the argument positions of forms
  are evaluated according to the same rules
- Scheme and Clojure are Lisp1 dialects

Lisp2
- has distinct function and value namespaces
- the rules for evaluation in the functional position of a form are
  distinct from those in the argument positions of the form
- Common Lisp is a Lisp2 dialect
