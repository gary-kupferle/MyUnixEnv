Make Project Creator (MPC) Notes
  
Installation
- download from http://www.ociweb.com/products/mpc/down.html
- gunzip it and untar it
- add the directory containing it to PATH

Generating Makefiles
- enter "mwc.pl -type make"
- probably want to create a makegen alias to this command
- looks for all .mpc files in current directory and subdirectories
- generates Makefile.{project-name} for each project described in .mpc files
- generates Makefile that runs targets in all project-specific makefiles

Help
- to get help on MPC options, run "mpc.pl -help"

Here are some simple examples of using MPC.
All of them automatically find all .h and .cpp files
in and below the current directory.

By default, MPC creates a shared library in the current directory.
If exename is specified, it creates an executable.
Otherwise, it creates a shared library.

Example: Creating an executable (produces {exe-name})

project({project-name}) {
  exename = {exe-name}

  includes += {include-dir}
  libpaths += {lib-dir} // a location to search for shared libraries
  libs += {shared-lib-name} // without "lib" and ".so"
}

Example: Creating a shared library (produces lib{project-name}.so}

project({project-name}) {
  // If libout is omitted, the library is created in the current directory.
  libout = {lib-directory} // can be a relative directory like ..

  // Other options are the same as previous example except omit exename.
}

Can explicitly list source files to be compiled with
  Source_Files {
    {name}.cpp
    {name}.cpp
    ...
  }

Can require that a project be built after a list of other projects.
  after += {porject-1} {project-2} ...

Clean
- "make clean" doesn't delete generated executables,
  but "make realclean" does

Include Directories
- can be specified in a .mpw (workspace) file

Inheritance
- .mpc files can "inherit" rules in .mpb (base) files with
  project({project-name}) : {base-project-name} {

Search path
- MPC searches for .mpb files in the current directory
  and in directories specified in the -include option
