LESS is a CSS tool like Sass and Stylus

Here are some issues I have with LESS:

LESS requires all mixin parameters to have default values.
That means they cannot have required parameters.

LESS doesn't support conditional logic and looping. I think those
are important for implementing certain kinds of mixins.

Stylus looks much better than LESS.
It doesn't have any of the issues I identified in LESS.

It's too bad the authors of Sass, LESS and Stylus didn't get together
and create one awesome tool so we wouldn't have to choose between
them!
