# Progressive Web Apps Notes

## Resources

- <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/>

## React Details

- by default, NODE_ENV must be set to 'production'.
  - can remove this check for testing by modifying `registerServiceWorker.js`
- add a `meta` description inside the `head` tag in `public/index.html`
  - `<meta name="description" content="Example PWA built with React">`
- add a 192x192 icon and a 512x512 splash screen in `public/manifest.json`

  - .png files are recommended; Are they required to be PNGs?

  ```json
    "icons": [
  {
    "src": "splash-screen.png",
    "sizes": "512x512",
    "type": "image/png"
  },
  {
    "src": "big-icon.png",
    "sizes": "192x192",
    "type": "image/png"
  },
  {
    "src": "favicon.ico",
    "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
    "type": "image/x-icon"
  }
  ],
  ```

- add a button in `public/index.html` below the `div` with `id="root"`
  for the user to press to request adding the app to their home screen

  ```html
  <button id="addToHomeScreen">Add To Home Screen</button>
  ```

- add the following at the end of `src/index.js`

  ```js
  let deferredPrompt;
  const addBtn = document.querySelector('#addToHomeScreen');

  window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', e => {
    // Prevent Chrome 67 and earlier from automatically showing the prompt.
    e.preventDefault();
    deferredPrompt = e;
    addBtn.style.display = 'block';
  });

  addBtn.addEventListener('click', e => {
    addBtn.style.display = 'none';
    deferredPrompt.prompt();
    deferredPrompt.userChoice.then(choiceResult => {
      if (choiceResult.outcome === 'accepted') {
        console.log('User accepted the A2HS prompt');
      } else {
        console.log('User dismissed the A2HS prompt');
      }
      deferredPrompt = null;
    });
  });

  window.addEventListener('appinstalled', evt => {
    console.log('The app was installed!');
  });

  if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
    console.log('display-mode is standalone');
  }
  ```

- add code to automatically download a new version of the app
  if it is available when the app is started or refreshed

  - edit `src/registerServiceWorker.js`
  - in the function `registerValidSW` replace
    ```js
    console.log('New content is available; please refresh.');
    ```
    with
    ```js
    window.location.reload(true);
    ```
  - for large apps, this could cause the startup time to be slow

- to build and serve the app as a PWA

- `npm install -g serve`
- see steps in "Update on Version Changes" below for more

- to test for issues

- open Chrome devtools
- select the "Audits" tab
- press "Run audits" button

  - to run again, click "+" in upper-left of devtools
    and press "Run audits" button again

- click the score for "Progressive Web App"
- fix any issues identified

- in macOS, apps are installed in Desktop/Chrome Apps

- after making changes and rebuilding the app, in order to see the changes
  - without the call to `window.location.reload(true)` suggested above ...
  - if the app is already running, the user must refresh twice
    - the first refresh downloads new versions of the files
    - the second refresh loads the new files
  - if the app is not running, the user must start it and refresh once
    - running the app launches with the old versions of the files,
      but downloads new versions in the background?
    - refreshing loads the new files

## Updating on Version Changes

To check for updates at some interval and
allow the user to download a new version of the app,
add the following code at the bottom of `src/index.js`.

```js
function checkForUpdate() {
  fetch('version.txt')
    .then(res => res.text())
    .then(version => {
      const currentVersion = sessionStorage.getItem('app-version');
      if (
        version !== currentVersion &&
        window.confirm(
          'A new version of this app is available.  ' +
            'It will take a few seconds to download it.  ' +
            'Download now?'
        )
      ) {
        window.location.reload();
        sessionStorage.setItem('app-version', version);
      }
    })
    // Will get an error if the server is down.
    .catch(() => {}); // Ignore these errors.
}

setInterval(checkForUpdate, 5000);
```

This relies on the file `public/version.txt` being updated
before every new version is served. To automate this,
create `src/version.js` with the following content:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('public/version.txt', Date.now());
```

Add the following npm scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"build": "react-scripts build && npm run version",
"serve": "npm run build && cd build && serve",
"version": "node src/version.js"
```

To rebuild the latest code changes, update `public/version.txt`,
and serve the application from the `build` directory,
enter `npm run serve`.

After every code change, to deploy a new version of the app
kill the server and enter `npm run serve` again.

To run the app in the new browser tab, browse localhost:{port}
where port is output by the previous command.

## In Chrome

- to enable PWAs in Chrome (Are these steps really required?)

- browse chrome://flags
- change the dropdown for the following to "Enabled":
  "App Banners", "Experimental App Banners", and "Desktop PWAs"
- press the "RELAUNCH NOW" button so changes will take effect

- to find public PWAs

- browse <https://pwa.rocks>

- criteria for installing

- not already installed
- user has interacted with the domain for at least 30 seconds
- has a web app manifest (`manifest.json` file in public directory)
  that includes
  - short_name or name
  - icons of sizes 192px and 512px
  - start_url
  - display set to "fullscreen", "standalone", or "minimal-ui"
- served using HTTPS (required for service workers)
- service worker is registered with a "fetch" event handler
- if all the criteria above are met,
  Chrome will fire a `beforeinstallprompt` event
  that can be used to prompt the user to install the PWA

- to view manifest details in Chrome devtools

- browse app
- open devtools
- click "Application" tab
- click "Manifest" in left nav.
- there is an "Add to homescreen" link here!

  - does work yet for Tesla app
  - says "no matching service worker detected"

- to install a PWA

- browse to site in Chrome
  - ex. app.ft.com which is the Financial Times app
- click the vertical ellipsis in upper-right
- select "Install {app-name}"
- will see a dialog asking if you want to add the app "to desktop"
  - but that is not where it will be placed
- will be installed in `~/Applications/Chrome Apps`
  in a file with a `.app` extension

- to run an installed PWA

- double-click it

- to uninstall a PWA

- delete the `.app` file from the `~/Applications/Chrome Apps` directory
- but Chrome will still think it is installed
  and will not allow it to be installed again!

```

```
