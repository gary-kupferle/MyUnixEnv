    <h2>CruiseControl at FRB</h2>

    <h3>General Information</h3>
  
    <ul>

      <li>
        The main CruiseControl web site is
        <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

      <li>
        A Wiki with useful information on CruiseControl is
        <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/cc/home"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

      <li>CruiseControl is installed on the "build box"
          which is the PC named H1TRASSD6.
          This is the PC that was initially used by Mark Volkmann.</li>

      <li>The software is in C:\CruiseControl\cruisecontrol-2.1.6.</li>

      <li>For detailed setup instructions,
          see <a href="CruiseControlSetup.html">this</a>.</li>

      <li>CruiseControl is composed of two pieces.
          One is a process started from a command prompt
          that performs builds.
          The other is a web app. that provides reporting on builds.</li>

      <li>The reporting web app. can be found in
          C:\CruiseControl\cruisecontrol-2.1.6\reporting\jsp\dist\cruisecontrol.war.</li>

      <li>To build the reporting web app., open a command prompt,
          cd to C:\CruiseControl\cruisecontrol-2.1.6\reporting\jsp,
          and enter "build war".</li>

      <li>To deploy the reporting web app. to WebLogic,
          copy the WAR file to
          C:\bea\user_projects\domains\mydomain\applications.</li>

      <li>WebLogic is started by running
          C:\bea\user_projects\domains\mydomain\startWebLogic.cmd.
          There is a shortcut on the desktop for running this script.</li>

      <li>To start the CruiseControl build process,
          open a command prompt, cd to
          C:\cc_snapshot\h1mrv01_h7ptrs01\SHARED_VOB\Projects\CruiseControl
          and enter "startCC".</li>

      <li>To view the build history of all projects
          managed by CruiseControl open a web browser and visit
          <a href="http://h1trassd6:7001/cruisecontrol/" target="_blank">
          http://h1trassd6:7001/cruisecontrol/</a>.
      </li>

      <li>CruiseControl builds from ClearCase snapshot views that are
          stored on the build box in C:\C:\cc_snapshot\h1mrv01_h7ptrs01.
          This directory contains a subdirectory for each VOB.</li>

      <li>Configuration of CruiseControl is specified in
          C:\cc_snapshot\h1mrv01_h7ptrs01\SHARED_VOB\Projects\CruiseControl\config.xml.</li>

      <li>CruiseControl generates HTML reports on unit test results
          by applying XSLT stylesheets (using Xalan) to an XML log file.
          Merging of test result XML files with the CruiseControl
          log file is specified in the config.xml file.
          See the "log" element and its "merge" child elements.</li>

      <li>There is a known problem with generating the
          unit test results report when there are a large number of tests.
          Xalan can generate an OutOfMemoryError.
          This happens because some of the stylesheets use recursion
          to replace a few characters in the log XML file
          with specific strings and the stack grows too large.
          The stylesheets that do this are
          unittests.xsl and testdetails.xsl.
          These stylesheets can be found in the
          C:\CruiseControl\cruisecontrol-2.1.6\reporting\jsp\xsl directory.
          Mark Volkmann modified these stylesheets to use a slightly
          different approach for performing the string replacements.
          These stylesheets now import another stylesheet
          in C:\XML\XSLT\string-util.xslt.
          This seems to have fixed the problem.
          Whenever changes are made to the CruiseControl stylesheets,
          the CruiseControl web app. must be rebuilt and redeployed.
          The two "war" targets in the build.xml file in
          C:\CruiseControl\cruisecontrol-2.1.6\reporting\jsp
          were modified to include string-util.xslt.</li>

    </ul>
                  
    <h3>Details on config.xml</h3>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Information about the elements allowed in config.xml can be found
        <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/main/configxml.html"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

      <li>
        config.xml specifies
        <ul>
          <li>projects to be built (see "project" elements)</li>
          <li>location of source repository to be checked for changes
            (see "modificationset" elements)</li>
          <li>frequency (in seconds) to check for changes
            (see the "interval" attribute on "schedule" elements)</li>
          <li>amount of time (in seconds) with no repository changes
            that must pass before beginning a new build
            (see the "quietperiod" attribute
            of "modificationset" elements)</li>
          <li>location of unit test XML result files
            (see "merge" elements inside "log" elements)</li>
          <li>whose should receive build result reports via email
            (see "always" and "failure" elements
            inside "htmlemail" elements)</li>
          <li>and more</li>
        </ul>        
      </li>

      <li>
        Our config.xml currently describes three projects:
        FPS, SAM and Shared.</li>

      <li>
        The "ant" element inside the "schedule" element of each "project"
        specifies the Ant build file and target to be run
        when a ClearCase modification is detected.
        The three new Ant build files currently referenced
        are in the same directory as config.xml and are named
        fps-build.xml, sam-build.xml and shared-build.xml.</li>

      <li>
        The new Ant build files
        (fps-build.xml, sam-build.xml and shared-build.xml)
        perform two operations.
        First, they perform ClearCase updates to get the latest changes.
        Second, they execute "test" targets that have been added to
        the existing Ant build files in
        FPS_PROD_VOB, SAM_TRS_DEV and SHARED_VOB.
        The new "test" targets depend on
        existing "jar" or "war" targets,
        which depend on existing "compile" targets.</li>

      <li>
        The Ant targets referenced from config.xml
        can do anything we want them to do.
        Currently they build compile Java source,
        build JAR/WAR files and run JUnit tests.
        We could also run targets to
        deploy WAR/EAR files to a local server
        and run HttpUnit and/or Cactus tests.</li>

    </ul>
