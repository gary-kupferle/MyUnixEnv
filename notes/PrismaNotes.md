## Connecting to an existing database

There is currently very little documentation on doing this!
It is considered experimental.

1.  Translate your SQL schema into a GraphQL data model written in SDL.
2.  Deploy a Prisma service with that data model.
3.  If your database previously contained some data, import the data into your Prisma service.
