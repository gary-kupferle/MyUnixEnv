# Go Programming Language Notes

## Overview

- announced by Google in 2009
- originally designed to be a systems programming language
  - aims to be a better C
  - but most developers use C, C++, or Rust for that
- simplicity and performance are major goals
  so many features found in other programming languages
  are not present in Go
  - ex. generic types
- does not compete with scripting languages like
  JavaScript, Perl, Python, and Ruby
- currently the most common uses are for
  the server side of web application and dev ops tooling

## Future

- large, frequently requested features that may be added at some point include
  - generics
    - would allow generic functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
  - immutability
    - would provide guarantees to prevent accidental data mutations
  - modules
    - would support managing package versions used in a library or application

## Characteristics

- high performance
- statically typed
- compiled
- provides type inference
- performs garbage collection
- supports asynchronous processing with lightweight threads via goroutines
- provides communication between goroutines using channels
- supports networking operations
- supports concurrency
- supports JSON marshalling and unmarshalling
- minimal support for object-oriented programming
  - through structs with methods
- no builtin support for functional programming
  - for example, no builtin map, filter, and reduce functions for arrays
  - hard to implement due to lack of generics
- supports composition, but not inheritance of types
- no equivalent of the ternary operator found in other languages

## Reasons to use

- type safety
- performance
- network library

## Notable Things Implemented in Go

- Docker - assembles container-based systems
  (open source version is now called "Moby")
- Kubernetes - production-grade container scheduling and management
  <http://kubernetes.io>
- Revel - full-stack web framework <https://github.com/revel/revel>
- InfluxDB - scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics
  <https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb>
- any more you have probably not heard of

  - <https://react-etc.net/entry/webassembly-support-lands-in-go-language-golang-wasm-js>

## Syntax Highlights

- semicolons are not required,
  but can be used to place multiple statements on the same line
- types follow parameters, separated by a space
- exported variables and struct members have names that start uppercase
  - but only those at the top level of a source file,
    not those defined inside a function
- outside of functions, every line begins with a keyword
  - this explains why the `:=` operator is not allowed outside of functions

## Tooling

- `go` command has many sub-commands
- most commonly used commands

  - `go help [command|topic]`
    - outputs help
    - run with no argument to see a list of commands and topics
  - `go doc {pkg}`
    - outputs documentation for a given package
    - ex. `go doc json`
  - `go fix {file-or-directory-path}`
    - "finds Go programs that use old APIs and rewrites them to use newer ones."
    - "After you update to a new Go release,
      fix helps make the necessary changes to your programs."
  - `go get {pkg1} {pkg2} ...`
    - downloads and installs packages and their dependencies
  - `go build {file-name}.go`
    - builds an executable that includes everything needed to run
    - Go tools do not need to be installed in order to execute the result
  - `go install {pkg-name}`
    - builds a package and installs it in the directory in GOBIN
  - `go run {file-name}.go`
    - runs a program without producing an executable
  - `go test`
    - runs all the tests in the current package?
  - `go generate`

    - creates or updates Go source files
    - TODO: learn more about this

## Code Formatting

- gofmt tool
  - uses tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment

## VS Code Go Extension

- may need to
  - set GOPATH environment variable and restart VS Code before installing this
  - run `go get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode`
  - run `go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint`
  - set GOPATH to ~/go
  - create a `bin` subdirectory
  - set GOBIN to $GOPATH/bin
  - add $GOBIN to PATH
- why isn't "format on save" working?
- for a description of how this extension can use GOPATH see
  <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/GOPATH-in-the-VS-Code-Go-extension>

## Standard Library Packages

- to see a list of them, browse <https://golang.org/pkg/>

## Community Packages

- to see a list of them with links to documentation,
  browse one of these
  - <https://godoc.org/>
  - <https://go-search.org/>
  - <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Projects>

## Getting Started

- initial file must contain
  - `package main`
  - `func main() { ... }`
- can run with
  - `go run file-name.go`
  - `go build file-name.go; ./file-name`

## Important Environment Variables

- GOARCH
  - target architecture to use when compiling
- GOBIN
  - where packages are installed
- GOOS
  - target operating system when compiling
- GOPATH
  - where source files are located
  - change this when switching projects?
- GOROOT
  - what Go tools are installed

## Comments

- same a C
- `//` for single-line comments
- `/* ... */` for multi-line comments

## Variables

- mutable unless defined with `const`
- block-scoped
- names must start with a letter and
  can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- local to their package unless name starts uppercase
- can define a variable without initializing
  - `var x int`
  - will be initialized to the zero value for the type
  - it's an error if the variable has already been defined
- can define a variable with initial value
  and take advantage of type inference
  - `var x = 3`
- can provide type and initial value, but that is redundant
  - `var x int = 3`
- `var` can be used inside or outside of a function
- can define multiple variables with one `var` in two ways

  ```go
  var alpha, beta = 1, 2
  var (
    gamma = 3
    delta = 4
    name string // initialized to empty string
  )
  ```

- can assign a value to an already defined variable
  - `x = 4`
  - it's an error if the variable has not already been defined
- `:=` can only be used inside a function
  - defines and initializes a new variable
    without specifying the type which is inferred
  - `x := 5` is shorthand for `var x = 5`
  - particularly useful for capturing function return values
    and creating multiple variables in a single line
- the variable "\_" is used to discard a function return value
- uninitialized variables are set to their "zero value"
  - false for bool
  - 0 for numbers
  - "" for strings
  - nil for pointers, slices, maps, functions, interfaces, and channels
  - TODO: What is the zero value for an array? An empty array?

## Constants

- defined with `const` keyword
- must be initialized to a primitive literal or an expression
  that can be computed at compile-time and results in a primitive value
- ex. const BLACKJACK = 21

## Operators

- arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, `%` (mod)
- arithmetic assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `\*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- increment: `++`
- decrement: `--`
- assignment: `=` (existing variable), `:=` (new variable)
- comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - arrays are compared by comparing their elements
  - structs are compared by comparing their fields
  - slices, maps, and functions cannot be compared
- logical: `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not)
- bitwise: `&`, `|`, `^`, `&^` (bit clear)
- bitwise assignment: `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `&^=`
- bit shift: `<<`, `>>`
- bit shift assignment: `<<=`, `>>=`
- channel direction: `<-`
- variadic parameter: `...paramName`
- slice spread: `sliceName...`
- pointer creation: `&varName`
- pointer dereference: `\*pointerName`
- block delimiters: `{ }`
- expression grouping: `( )`
- function calling: `fnName(args)`
- create array: `[elements]`
- struct member reference: `structName.memberName`
- statement separator: `;`
- array element separator: `,`
- define label: `someLabel:` (see `goto` keyword)

## Keywords

- `break` - breaks out of a `for` loop, `select`, or `switch`
- `case` - used in a `select` or `switch`
- `chan` - channel type
- `const` - declares a constant
- `continue` - advances to the next iteration of a for loop
- `default` - the default case in a `select` or `switch`
- `defer` - defers execution of a given function until the containing function exits
  - TODO: When is this useful? Why not move the call to the end of the function?
- `else` - part of an `if`
- `fallthrough` - used as last statement in a `case` to execute code in next `case`
- `for` - only loop syntax; C-style (init, condition, and post) or just condition
- `func` - defines a named or anonymous function
- `go` - precedes a function call to execute it asynchronously as a goroutine
- `goto` - jumps to a given label (see `:` operator)
- `if` - for conditional logic; also see `else`
- `import` - imports all the exports in given package(s)
  - see "Packages" section for more detail
- `interface` - defines a set of methods
  - defines a type where all implementing structs are compatible
  - structs do not state the interfaces they implement,
    they just implement all the methods
- `map` - type for a collection of key/value pairs where the keys and values can be any type
- `package` - specifies the package to which the current source file belongs
- `range` - used in a `for` loop to iterate over a string, array, slice, map, or receiving channel
- `return` - terminates the containing function and returns zero or more values
- `select` - chooses from a set of channel send or receive operations; see "Select" section
- `struct` -
- `switch` - similar to other languages; see "Switch" section
- `type` -
- `var` -

## Pointers

- hold the address of a variable or `nil
- `*Type` is the type for a pointer to a value of type `Type`
- to get the address of a variable
  - myPtr = &myVar
  - cannot get the address of a constant
- to get the value at a pointer
  - myValue = \*myPtr
- to modify the value at a pointer
  - \*myPtr = newValue
- pointer arithmetic is not supported

```go
var ptr *person // initialized to nil
ptr = &person // pointer to previously created person struct
var name1 = (*ptr).name
var name2 = ptr.name // shorthand for above, automatically dereferenced
```

## Output

- supported by the "fmt" package

```go
import "fmt"
fmt.Println(expression)
```

## If Statement

- parentheses are not needed around the condition being tested
- braces around body are required
- ex.

  ```go
  if x > 7 {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
  ```

- can include a single initialization statement before the condition

  - the scope of the variable is the if statement,
    including the else block if present

  ```go
  if y := x * 2; y < 10 {
    ...
  }
  ```

## Switch Statement

- similar to other languages
- can switch on expressions of any type
- braces around body are required
- case values can be literal values or expressions
- case blocks do not fall through by default so `break` is not needed
- can use `fallthrough` to get this
- ex.

  ```go
  switch name {
    case "Mark":
      // handle Mark
    case "Tami":
      // handle Tami
    default:
      // handle all other names
  }
  ```

- omit expression after `switch` to run the first `case` block that evaluates to true

  - ex.

    ```go
    switch {
      case name == "Mark":
        // handle Mark
      case age < 20:
        // handle youngsters
      default:
        // handle all other cases
    }
    ```

- to switch on the type of an expression

  ```go
  switch value := expression.(type) {
    case int, float:
      // handle int or float
    case string:
      // handle string
    default:
      // handle all other types
  }
  ```

  - the variable `value` will have the actual type
  - `value :=` can be omitted if not needed
  - expression can be an interface type and
    the actual type can be type that implements the interface

## For Statement

- the only looping statement
- braces around body are required
- can use `break` and `continue` inside
- syntax is `for init; cond; post { ... }`
  - no parentheses are allowed
- ex.

  ```go
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    ...
  }
  ```

- init and post are optional

  - so a while loop in other languages looks like this in go

  ```go
  for ; i < 10; {
    ...
  }
  ```

  - or drop the semicolons because when only one part is present it is assumed to be the condition

  ```go
  for i < 10 {
    ...
  }
  ```

  - omit the condition for an endless loop

  ```go
  for {
    ...
  }
  ```

## Strings

- immutable sequences of bytes representing UTF-8 characters
- literal values are delimited with double quotes or back-ticks (to include newlines)
- to declare and initialize, `name := "Mark"`
- to retrieve a character, `char := name[index]`
- it iterate over, `for _, char := range name { ... }`
- can concatenate with the `+` and `+=` operators
- the `string` type has no methods; use functions in the `strings` package
  - ex. to split a string on whitespace characters
    ```go
    s := "This is a test."
    words := strings.Fields(s)
    for _, word := range(words) {  
      fmt.Println(word) // outputs "This", "is", "a", and "test."
    }
    ```

## Structs

- a collection of fields defined with the `struct` keyword
- often will want to defined a type name for a struct
- use the dot operator to get and set fields

```go
type person struct {
  name string
  age int8
}

var p1 = person{name: "Mark", age: 57} // initialize by field name
var p2 = person{"Mark", 57} // initialize by field position
// Uninitialized fields are initialized to their zero value.
fmt.Println(p1.name) // Mark
p2.age++

// Print just the field values
fmt.Println(p2) // {Mark 58}

// Print all struct keys and values for debugging.
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", p2) // main.person{name:"Mark", age:58}
```

- struct names must start uppercase if they
  should be accessible outside the current package
- field names must also start uppercase
  if they should be accessible outside the current package

## Methods

- methods can be associated with a struct
- cannot overload methods to create different implementations
  for different parameter types
- an instance of a struct is referred to as the "receiver" for the method
- ex.

  ```go
  // Add a method to the type "pointer to a person struct".
  // Note how the receiver and its type appear
  // in parentheses before the method name.
  func (p *person) birthday() {
  		  p.age++
  }

  p := person{name: "Mark", age: 57}
  (&p).birthday() // invoked on a pointer to a struct
  p.birthday() // invoked on a struct
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", p) // main.person{name:"Mark", age:58}
  ```

- in the previous example the receiver is a pointer to a struct
- allows the method to modify the struct and avoids making a copy of the struct
  - for these reasons, most methods take a pointer
- when the receiver is a struct and not a pointer to a struct
  the method receives a copy and cannot modify the original
- when a function has a parameter with a pointer type,
  it must be passed a pointer
- when a method has a pointer receiver,
  it can be invoked on a pointer to a struct or a struct
  - if invoked on a struct, it will automatically
    pass a pointer to the struct to the method
- can also add methods to primitive types if a type alias is created

  - otherwise get "cannot define new methods on non-local type"

  ```go
  type number int

  func (receiver number) double() number {
    return receiver * 2
  }

  var n number = 3
  // or could use: n := number(3)
  fmt.Println(n.double())
  ```

## Arrays

- indexes are zero-based
- have a fixed length
- declare with `[length]type`
  - ex. `var rgb [3]int`
  - placing the square brackets BEFORE the type comes from Algol 68
  - if anything other than a single integer is inside []
    it is a slice (see the "Slices" section)
- can initialize with values in curly braces
  - ex. `rgb := [3]int{100, 50, 234}`
- can get the value at an index
  - ex. `fmt.Println(rgb[1])`
- can change the value at an index
  - ex. `rgb[1] = 75`
- get length with `len(myArr)`
- array elements can be arrays
- to iterate over the elements in an array

  ```go
  for index, value := range myArr {
    ...
  }
  ```

## Slices

- a view into an array with a variable length
- create by specifying the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indexes of an array
  - ex. `mySlice := myArr[start:end]`
  - if `start` is omitted, it defaults to 0
  - if `end` is omitted, it defaults to the array length
  - so `myArr[:]` creates a slice over the entire array
- modifying elements of a slice modifies the underlying array
- multiple slices on the same array see the same data
- a slice literal creates a slice and an underlying array
  - ex. `mySlice := []int{2, 4, 6}`
  - looks like an array literal, but without a specified length
  - can also specify values at specific indices
    - ex. `mySlice := []int{2: 6, 1: 4, 0: 2} // same as above`
- `len(mySlice)` returns the number of elements it contains (length)
- `cap(mySlice)` returns the number of elements in the underlying array (capacity)
- to extend a slice, recreated it with different bounds
  - ex. `mySlice = mySlice[newStart:newEnd]`
- the zero value is nil
- `make` function
  - can create a "dynamically-sized array"
  - this is the most common way to create a slice,
    rather than manually creating the underlying array
    and then creating the slice
  - ex. `mySlice := make([]int, 5)`
    - creates an underlying array of size 5
      and a slice of length 5 and capacity of 5
  - ex. `mySlice := make([]int, 0, 5)`
    - creates an underlying array of size 5 and
      a slice with initial length 0 and initial capacity of 5
  - to expand the size of the slice
    `mySlice = mySlice[newStart:newEnd]`
- slice elements can be slices (multidimensional slices)

```go
ticTacToe := [][]string{
  []string{" ", " ", " "},
  []string{" ", " ", " "},
  []string{" ", " ", " "}}
  // If the last } is placed on a new line then a
  // comma is required at the end of the previous line.
}
ticTacToe[1][2] = "X"
```

- to append new elements to a slice
  - this is where it really gets dynamic!
  - `mySlice = append(mySlice, 8, 10)`
  - appends the values 8 and 10
  - if the underlying array is too small,
    a larger array is automatically allocated
    and the returned slice will refer to it
    - since this can be inefficient, try to
      estimate the largest size needed at the start
  - cannot append to arrays which is a reason why slices are used more
- to use all the elements in a slice as separate arguments to a function
  follow the variable name holding the slice with an ellipsis
- slice of structs example

  ```go
  type person struct {
    name string
    age  int8
  }

  func main() {
    // Note how we do not need to precede each struct with "person".
    people := []person{{"Mark", 57}, {"Jeremy", 31}}
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", people)
    // []main.person{main.person{name:"Mark", age:57}, main.person{name:"Jeremy", age:31}}
  }
  ```

## Maps

- collections of key/value pairs where keys and values can be any type
- to declare, `map[keyType]valueType`
  - ex. `var myMap map[string]int`
- to declare and initialize,
  `var myMap = map[keyType]valueType{k1: v1, k2: v2, ...}`
  or
  `myMap := map[keyType]valueType{k1: v1, k2: v2, ...}`
- to add a key/value pair, `myMap[key] = value`
- to get the value for a given key, `value := myMap[key]`
- to get the value for a given key and verify that the key was present,
  as opposed to just getting the zero value because it wasn't

  ```go
  value, found := myMap[key]
  if found { ... }
  ```

- to delete a key/value pair, `delete(myMap, key)`
- to iterate over, `for key, value := range myMap { ... }`

## Concurrency

- see Goroutines, Channels, and Select

## Goroutines

- a lightweight thread of execution
- to create one, proceed any function call with `go`
- without using `go` the call is synchronous
- with using `go` the call is asynchronous
- the `main` function runs in a goroutine

## Channels

- pipes that connect concurrent goroutines
- can send values to them and receive values from them
- to create a channel, `myChannel := make(chan type)`
  where type is a real type like `string`
- to send a value to a channel, `myChannel <- value`
  - by default, blocks until the channel retrieves it (unbuffered)
- to retrieve a value from a channel, `value := <-channel`
  - by default, blocks until the channel sends it (unbuffered)
- channel direction

  - the type `chan` can send and receive values
  - to only allow sending, use `chan<-`
  - to only allow receiving, use `<-chan`

- buffered channels
  - accept a limited number of values with a corresponding receiver
  - to create, add size as second argument to make
    - ex. `myChannel := make(chan string, 5)`
  - there is probably no way to create a buffered channel with no size limit
- can use channels for synchronizing goroutine execution

  - to wait for a value to be sent to a channel, `<-myChannel`
  - to wait for a goroutine to complete, do something like this

  ```go
  import "time"

  func myAsync(done chan<- bool) { // can send, but not receive
    // Do some asynchronous thing.
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
    // When it completes, do this:
    done <- true
  }

  done := make(chan bool, 1)
  go myAsync(done)
  <-done
  ```

## Select

- can wait on multiple channels
- blocks until one of the channels is ready
- chooses randomly if multiple channels are ready
- `default` block, if present, is run if no channels are ready
- when using `break` in a `select` `case` that is inside a `for` loop,
  to jump out of the loop add a label before the loop and break to it

  - alternatively use `return` to exit the containing function

  - ex.

    ```go
    c1 := make(chan string)
    c2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
      time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
      c1 <- "one"
    }()
    go func() {
      time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
      c2 <- "two"
    }()

    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
      select {
      case msg1 := <-c1:
        fmt.Println("received", msg1)
      case msg2 := <-c2:
        fmt.Println("received", msg2)
      }
    }
    ```

## Functions

- defined with `func` keyword

```go
func myFunctionName(p1 t1, p2 t2, ...) returnType(s) {
  ...
}
```

- act as closures over all in-scope variables
- arguments are passed by value so copies are made of arrays, slices, and structs
- to avoid creating copies of structs, arrays, and slices,
  pass and accept pointers
- parameters cannot be optional
- cannot specify default values for parameters
- cannot overload functions to create different implementations
  for different parameter types
- can pass functions to a function
- can return functions from a function

- anonymous functions have the same syntax, but omit the name

  - ex. `func(v int) int { return v * 2 }`

- parameter types
  - when consecutive parameters have the same type,
    can omit the type from all but the last
  - ex. `func foo(p1 int, p2 int, p3 string, p4 string)`
    is equivalent to `func foo(p1, p2 int, p3, p4 string)`
- variadic functions
  - to accept a variable number of arguments
    precede last argument type with an ellipsis
  - ex.
    ```go
    func log(args ...any) {
      fmt.Println(args)
    }
    ```
- spreading a slice
  - to pass all the elements in a slice as separate arguments
    follow the argument with an ellipsis
  - ex. `log(mySlice...)`
- can return zero or more values

  - when there is more than one return value, the types
    must be surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas
    - why are parentheses required?
    - the return types are already guaranteed to be
      between the closing ) of the parameter list
      and the opening { of the code block

  ```go
  func GetStats(numbers []int) (int, float32) {
    sum := 0
    for _, number := range numbers {
      sum += number
    }
    average := float32(sum) / float32(len(numbers))
    return sum, average
  }

  func main() {
    sum, avg := GetStats(someNumbers)
  }
  ```

- named return values

  - if names are given to return types,
    a "naked return" will return them
  - ex.

    ```go
    func mult(n int) (times2, times3 int) {
      times2 = n * 2
      times3 = n * 3
      //return times2 times3 // don't need to specify return values
      return
    }

    // In some other function
    n2, n3 := mult(3) // n2 is 6 and n3 is 9
    ```

  - seems bad for readability

- deferred functions
  - inside a function, function calls preceded by `defer`
    will have their arguments evaluated,
    but will not execute until the containing function exits
  - all deferred calls are placed on a stack and
    executed in the reverse order from which they are evaluated
  - typically used for resource cleanup such as closing files that
    must occur regardless of the code path taken in the function

## Interfaces

- an interface defines a set of methods and a type
- all structs that implement all the methods are compatible
- structs do not state the interfaces they implement,
  they just implement all the methods
- calling a method on a variable with an interface type
  calls the method on the underlying struct type
- if a value has not be assigned to the variable,
  calling a method on it results in an error
- an interface with no methods, referred to as the "empty interface")
  matches every type
  - may want to give this a name using `type any interface{}`
- ex.

  ```go
  package main
  import "fmt"
  import "math"

  type geometry interface {
    area() float64
  }

  type rect struct {
    width, height float64
  }
  func (r rect) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
  }

  type circle struct {
    radius float64
  }
  func (c circle) area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
  }

  func printArea(g geometry) {
    fmt.Println("area =", g.area())
  }

  func main() {
    r := rect{width: 3, height: 4}
    c := circle{radius: 5}
    var g geometry
    //printArea(g) // panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
    g = r
    printArea(g)
    g = c
    printArea(g)
  }
  ```

- a type assertion verifies that an interface variable refers to a specific type
  - ex. `myShape := g.(Rectangle)`
  - triggers a panic if it does not (TODO: It doesn't for me!)
- a type test determines whether an interface variable refers to a specific type
  - ex. `myShape, ok := g.(circle)`
  - `ok` will be set to `true` or `false` to indicate whether `g` refers to a `circle`
  - a panic will not be triggered

## Builtin Constants

- listed as being in a package named "builtin" for documentation purposes,
  but no such package actually exists
- boolean literals `true` and `false`
- `iota` - an untyped int whose value is zero
  - TODO: when is this typically used?

## Builtin Variables

- listed as being in a package named "builtin" for documentation purposes,
  but no such package actually exists
- `nil` - the zero value for a pointer, channel, func, interface, map, or slice

## Documentation Types

- these types appear in documentation, but are not real types
- `Type` - represents a specific type for a given function invocation
- `Type1` - like `Type`, but for a different type than it
- `ComplexType` - represents a complex64 or complex128
- `FloatType` - represents a float32 or float64
- `IntegerType` - represents any int type

## Builtin Types

- float32 float64
- complex64 complex128
- string
  - literal values are surrounded by " or `
  - "" strings cannot contain newlines and can contain escape sequences like \n
  - '' strings can contain newline characters
  - indexed from zero
  - to get the 3rd character, `str[2]`
- the size of int, uint, and uintptr are usually

  - 32 bits on 32-bit systems
  - 64 bits on 64-bit systems

- `bool` - values are the builtin constants `true` and `false`
  - can use with the operators &&, ||, and !
- `byte` - alias for uint8
- `complex64` and `complex128` - complex numbers
- `float32` and `float64` floating-point numbers
- `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64` - signed integers
  - `int` is at least 32 bits
- `uint`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64` - unsigned integers
  - `uint` is at least 32 bits
- `uintptr` - holds any kind of pointer
- `rune` - alias for int32; used for unicode characters
  that range in size from 1 to 4 bytes
  - literal values are surrounded by '
- `string` - a sequence of 8-bit bytes, not unicode characters

## Builtin Functions

- these are listed as being in a package named "builtin"
  for documentation purposes, but no such package actually exists

### for complex numbers

- `complex` - constructs a complex value from two floating-point values
- `imag(c ComplexType) FloatType` - returns the imaginary part of a complex number
- `real` - returns the real part of a complex number

### for output

- `print(args ...Type)` - writes to stderr;
  useful for debugging; may be dropped from language
- `println(args ...Type)` - like `print` but adds newline

### for data structures

- `append(slice []Type, elems ...Type) []Type` -
  appends elements to the end of a slice and returns the updated slice
- `cap(v Type) int` - returns the capacity of v
- `copy(dst, src []Type) int` - copies elements from a source slice
  to a destination slice and returns the number off elements copied
- `delete(m map[Type]Type1, key Type)` - deletes the element at a key from a map
- `len(v Type) int` - returns the length of v where v is a string, array, slice, or map?
- `make(t Type, size ...IntegerType) Type` -
  allocates and initializes a slice, map, or chan;
  if Type is Slice, pass the length, and optional capacity;
  if Type is Map, optionally specify number of key/value pairs for which to allocate space
- `new(Type) *Type` - allocates memory for a given type and returns pointer to it

### for channels

- `close(c chan<-)` - closes a channel after the last sent value is received
- `make(Channel, [buffer-capacity])` - unbuffered if buffer-capacity is omitted

### for error handling

- `panic(v interface{})` - stops normal execution of the current goroutine;
  cascades upward through call stack;
  terminates program and reports an error condition;
  can be controlled by the `recover` function
  - similar to `throw` in other languages
- `recover` - call inside a deferred function to
  stop the panic sequence and restore normal execution
  - similar to `catch` in other languages
- `error` - type that represents an error condition
  - has value `nil` when there is no error

## Type Conversions

- no conversions are performed implicitly
- builtin types can be used as conversion functions
- ex. `var f = float32(i)`
- will get an error if conversion cannot be done
  - for example attempting to convert a string to an int
  - will not convert a string containing a valid number to a number
    - use `strconv` package for this
    ```go
    s := "19"
    n, err := strconv.ParseInt(s, 10, 32) // base 10, bitsize 32
    ```

## Packages

- all code is in some package
- the `main` function is the starting point of all Go applications
  and must in the `main` package
- `import`
  - used to import all exported symbols (names that start uppercase) from given packages
  - can't import just a subset
  - the strings given to `import` are slash-separated paths
    where the last part is the package name
    - ex. in `import "math/rand"` the package name is "rand"
  - to import one package, `import "pkgName"`
  - to import multiple packages, `import ("pkgName1" "pkgName2" ...)`
  - can alias a package name with `import alias pkgName`
    and then reference exported names with `alias.exportedName`
- will get an error if no symbols from an import are used
- exported names must be referenced with `pkgName.exportedName`
- package implementations must be in a directory whose name matches the package name
- files that define the package must be in that directory,
  but can have any name that ends with `.go`
  - ex. if the package "baz" is defined by files in `$GOPATH/src/foo/bar/baz`
    then it is imported with `import "foo/bar/baz"` and
    the symbols it exports are references with `baz.exportedName`
- standard library packages
  - always available and do not need to be installed
  - documented at <https://golang.org/pkg/>
  - import like any other package
- community packages
  - need to be installed, typically using `go get package-name`
  - the string after `import` is the package URL without the "https://" prefix
  - ex. `go get github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter`
    - installs in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/juleienschmit/httprouter`
    - `go get` will install under `$GOPATH/src`
      regardless of the directory from which it is run
    - to use in a .go file, `import "github.com/juleienschmit/httprouter"`
      and refer to the names it exports by preceding the names with `httprouter`
- currently there is no support for package versioning
  - nothing like npm and package.json in JavaScript
  - future module support should add this
    - see <https://research.swtch.com/vgo-module>

## Error Handling

- exceptions are not supported
- instead functions that may encounter errors have an
  additional return value of type `error` that callers must check

  ```go
  package main
  import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
  )

  func divide(a, b float32) (float32, error) {
  if b == 0 {
    return 0, errors.New("divide by zero")
  }
    return a / b, nil
  }

  func main() {
    q, err = divide(7, 0)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Print(err) // prints error message
    } else {
      fmt.Print(q)
    }
  }
  ```

## Tests

- implement tests in files whose name ends with `_test.go`
- `import "testing"` - a standard package
- write test functions whose names begin with `Test`
- these functions take one argument, `t \*testing.T`
- if a test assertion fails
  - call `t.Error(message)`
  - call `t.Errorf(formatString, values)`
  - can call `t.Fail()`, but that fails with no message
- to log a message in a test
  - call `t.Log(message)`
- "examples" are another way to write test functions
  - example function names begin with `Example`,
    followed by the name of the function or type being tested
    - when testing a method, end the function name with
      the type name followed by an underscore and the method name
  - example functions end with the comment `// Output:`
    followed by comment lines containing the expected output
- also see "benchmark" tests which are only run when the `-bench` flag is used
- ex. in src/statistics.go

  ```go
  package statistics

  func Sum(numbers []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for _, number := range numbers {
      sum += number
    }
    return sum
  }
  ```

- ex. in src/statistics_test.go

  ```go
  package statistics

  import (
    "fmt"
    "testing"
  )

  func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
    sum := Sum(nums)
    if (sum != 6) {
      t.Error("expected sum to be 6")
    }
  }

  func ExampleSun() {
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("sum is", Sum(nums))
    // Output:
    // sum is 6
  }
  ```

- run by entering `go test` in the directory of the tests

## Not Functional

- Go doesn't support functional programming out of the box
- can simulate some features like this

  ```go
  type intToIntFn = func(int) int

  func mapOverInts(arr []int, fn intToIntFn) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(arr))
    for i, v := range(arr) {
      result[i] = fn(v)
    }
    return result
  }

  rgb := [3]int{100, 50, 234}
  double := func(v int) int { return v * 2 }
  log(mapOverInts(rgb[:], double))
  ```

## Debugging Tips

- to print a struct including keys and values,
  `fmt.Printf("%#v\n", obj)`

## Packaging Versioning

- still an open issue in the Go community
- one current solution is to use vGo from Rus Cox at <https://research.swtch.com/vgo>
  - will be included in Go 1.11

## Important Standard Packages

- Go provides many packages in the standard library
- these are some of the more commonly used packages
- bufio - implements buffered I/O with Reader and Writer types
- builtin - not a real package, but a place to document
  builtin constants, variables, functions, and types
- container.list - implements doubly linked lists
- database - defines interfaces implemented by database-specific drivers
- encoding - defines interfaces for reading and writing
  various data formats such as csv, json, and xml
- errors - defines `New` function to create error structs with a string
  description and a method to get those strings from an error struct
- flag - implements command-line flag parsing
- fmt - implements formatted I/O similar to C's `printf` and `scanf`
- go - subpackages implement all the standard go tooling
  such as source file parsing to ASTs and code formatting
- html - implements functions to parse and create HTML
- image - implements functions to parse (decode) and create (encode) images
- io - implements functions to read and write buffers and files
- log - implements simple logging
- math - implements many math functions
- mime - encodes and decodes multimedia formats
- net - implements network I/O including TCP and UDP
- net/http - implements functions to send and listen for HTTP and HTTPS requests
- os - provides access to operating system functionality
  like that provided by UNIX shell commands
  - exposes the constants PathSeparator ('/' on UNIX)
    and PathListSeparator (':' on UNIX)
- path - implements functions for working with UNIX-style file paths and URLs
- reflect - implements run-time reflection to work with types determined at run-time

    `Repeat`, `Split`, `ToLower`, `ToTitle`, `ToUpper`, and `Trim`
  - defines `Builder`, `Reader`, and `Replacer` types
- sync - provides synchronization primitives such as mutual exclusion locks
  - typically will use channels and `select` instead
- testing - supports automated tests run by `go test`
  - quick sub-package implements fuzz testing
- text - provides functions for parsing text,
  writing tabbed columns, and data-driven templates
- time - provides functions to measure and display time and dates

- also see "sub-repositories" that are part of the Go project,
  but maintained outside the main repository

## Command-Line Arguments

- a slice of the command-line arguments is stored in os.Args
  which is accessible via `import "os"'
- index 0 holds the path to the executable
  which is dynamically created when "go run" is used
- index 1 holds the first command-line-argument
- ex. in file named `greet.go`

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
  )

  func main() {
    args := os.Args[1:]
    if len(args) != 2 {
      fmt.Println("usage: greet {first-name} {last-name}")
      os.Exit(1)
    }
    firstName := args[0]
    lastName := args[1]
    fmt.Printf("Hello %s %s!\n", firstName, lastName)
  }
  ```

- to run, enter `go run greet.go Mark Volkmann`
- to build and run, enter `go build greet.go; ./greet Mark Volkmann`
