ClearCase Command-line Commands

SOSCOE
  The Boeing SOSCOE project provides many scripts
  to simplify use of ClearCase.
  They are in /soscoe/ccase/scripts.

Help

  To get help on a command,
    cleartool man {command}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Config. Specs.

  Output config. spec.
    cd to /view/{view-name} or any subdirectory
    cleartool catcs

  Edit config. spec.
    cd to /view/{view-name} or any subdirectory
    cleartool edcs

  Comments inside
    use leading #

  Latest
    it is common to include the following as the last line:
    element * /main/LATEST

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOBs

  List VOBs
    ct lsvob

  Mount VOB
    ct mount {vob-tag}

  Unmount VOB
    ct unmount {vob-tag}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branches

  List branch types
    cd {directory-of-vob}
    ct lstype -kind brtype | grep jz317b

  Create branch type (only for VOB of current directory)
    cd {directory-of-vob}
    ct mkbrtype -ordinary {branch-name}
    For COS the branch-name should be jz317b_cos0.0_cr{cr#}
    or jz317b_soscoe1.0jucas_pcr{pcr#}_cr{cr#}

  List files in a given VOB that were modified on a given branch
    ct find {vob-name} -branch 'brtype({branch-name})' -nxn -print
    An example vob-name is /vobs/COS_MW_Code.
    An example branch-name is jz317b_cos0.0_cr14336.
    If files were added, only the directory is output.

  Delete a file from a branch
    ct rmbranch -nc {file}@@{branch-full-path}
    An example branch-full-path is /main/cos0.0_stl/jz317b_cos0.0_cr14264.

  Delete a branch
    ct rmtype -rmall brtype:{branch-name}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Views

  Show current view
    cleartool pwv

  List available views
    cleartool lsview

  Create a view
    ct mkview -tag {view-name} {storage-directory}
    (For COS, storage-directory should be
     /data03/jucas/ccdata/viewstrg/{view-name}.)

    Another way to create a COS view under Linux is to run the script
    /data01/jucas/scripts/view_scripts/make_view.pl.
    (The config. spec. this creates may not use
     the current versions of some things.)

  Set view
    cleartool setview {view-name}
    (Note that setview isn't available in Windows.
     Use startview instead.)
    (For JUCAS work, run ~/COSsetup.sh after this!)

  Delete view
    /soscoe/ccase/scripts/remove_view.pl

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Labels

  Add a label to all files in a directory
  - convention is for labels to be all uppercase
  - cd to directory containing files to be labelled
  - ct mklbtype -nc {label}
  - ct mklabel -recurse {label} .
  - ct mklbtype -nc {label}
  - cd to parent directory and run "ct mklabel {label} .
  - repeat previous step until top VOB directory is reached

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add directory (must be empty)
  cleartool co -nc .
  cleartool mkdir -nc {dir}
  cleartool ci -nc {dir}
  cleartool ci -nc .

Add file
  cleartool co -nc .
  cleartool mkelem -nc {file}
  (can also use "find . -name '*' | xargs cleartool mkelem -nc"
   to add many files at once)
  cleartool ci -nc {file}
  cleartool ci -nc .

Cat an earlier revision
  copy the version string from output of lshistory
  paste it after a cat command
  for example,
  cat {file-name}@@/main/soscoe2.5/{view-name}/{revision-number}

Check-in
  cleartool ci -nc {file}
  cleartool ci -c '{comment}' {file}
  To check in all files that are checked out with the same comment,
    alias lsco 'ct lsco -s -cvi -a'
    lsco | xargs cleartool ci -c '{comment}'
    You defined the following alias.
    alias ciall 'lsco | xargs grep cleartool ci -c '
    To use this, enter "ciall {comment}".
    Also see /soscoe/ccase/scripts/ci_all.pl.

Check-out latest revision
  cleartool co -nc [-unr] {file}
    -nc is for no comment
    -unr is for unreserved

Check-out an earlier revision
  cleartool co -ver {file}@@{version-string}
  * The string after -ver is just like what is displayed by lshistory.

Delete a file
  cleartool co -nc .
  cleartool rm -nc {file}
  cleartool ci -nc .

Delete a version of a file
  cleartool rmver -version {version-spec} {file}

Delete view private files
  cleartool lsprivate | xargs rm -rf

Differences between checked out, modified file and last version checked in
  cleartool diff -g -pred {file}

Differences between specific revisions of a file
  cleartool lsvtree -g {file}
  click a circle to select the first revision
  select Version...Diff...Selected vs. other...
  a new dialog will appear
  click a circle to select the second revision
  press the OK button

Differences between files on a branch and current view
  cleartool find . -branch 'brtype({branch})' -nxn \
  -exec 'cleartool diff -g $CLEARCASE_XPN/LATEST $CLEARCASE_PN'

Find files modified in the current view from
their state at the time the view was created
  /soscoe/ccase/scripts/find_changed_files.pl

Find where files were obtained (within config. spec lines)
  cleartool ls [{file}]

History
  cleartool lshistory {file}

List check-outs
  - only in your view
    cleartool lsco -s -avobs -cvi
    * -s is for short output
    * -avobs is for all vobs
    * -cvi is for current view only
  - of a specific file in any view
    cleartool lsco {file}

List view private files
  cleartool ls -l -recurse | grep private
  cleartool lsprivate | grep -v "\.o" | grep -v "\.so"
  You have the script "lsprivate" in ~/bin that does this.

Merge - command line
  cd {top-vob-dir} (for example, /vobs/fcsc_userProfilePolicy)
  ct findmerge . -all -fver .../{from-view-name}/LATEST -merge -gmerge
  * note that only checked in files are merged

Merge - graphical
  start Exceed
  cleartool lsvtree -g {file}
  click merge button in toolbar
  select version to merge from
  select version to merge to
  click "Yes" button to try automatic merge
  select File...Update..Force on this Browser
  select latest version
  click diff button (triangle) in toolbar to verify changes
  close lsvtree window

Modify a private copy of a file
- for cases where you need to temporarily change a file
  and not checkin the changes
  1) cp {file-name} {file-name}-save
  2) cleartool edcs
  3) add the following line after "element * CHECKEDOUT" (first line)
     element {file-path} -none
  4) mv {file-name}-save {file-name}
  5) edit {file-name}

Move a file
  to move a file from one directory to another
  cleartool co {src-dir}
  cleartool co {target-dir}
  cleartool mv {src-dir}/{file} {target-dir}
  cleartool ci {src-dir}
  cleartool ci {target-dir}

Remove a file
  cleartool co {src-dir}
  cleartool rnname {src-dir}/{file}
  cleartool ci {src-dir}

Uncheckout
  cleartool unco [-rm] {file}
    -rm doesn't keep a copy of the local version
  /soscoe/ccase/scripts/unco_all.pl

Update a view
  ct setview {view-name}
  cd {top-directory-to-be-updated}
  /soscoe/ccase/scripts/update_view.pl
  Note that this doesn't update your config. spec.

Version tree graphical view
  start Exceed
  cleartool lsvtree -g {file}

Version-extended paths
/view/{view-name}/vobs/{rest-of-path}@@{label}
