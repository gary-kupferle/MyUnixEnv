NIEM Notes

- see http://www.niem.gov/
- stands for National Information Exchange Model
- an XML-based standard for exchanging information between
  federal, state, local and tribal agencies
- created by a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
  and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
- extends the Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM)
  to support data needed for:
  * justice
  * public safety
  * emergency and disaster management
  * intelligence
  * homeland security
- provides reusable software components for working with NIEM data
- provides a tool that builds a schema subset for the data
  that must be exchanged by a particular application
  * see "Build Schema Subset" at
    http://niem.gtri.gatech.edu/niemtools/home.iepd
- while OCI doesn't have specific expertise in NIEM,
  we do have significant experience in using XML Schemas to:
  * understand and explain the requirements on conforming XML
  * automate generation of conforming XML from
    a variety of data sources including
    relational databases and in-memory object graphs
  * automate parsing of XML to create corresponding object graphs
  * generate source code from XML Schemas that
    simplifies working with conforming XML
    - both custom code generation and using JAXB
