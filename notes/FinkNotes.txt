Fink Notes

- "We modify Unix software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X
  (port it) and make it available for download as a coherent distribution.
  Fink uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get to provide powerful
  binary package management. You can choose whether you want to download
  precompiled binary packages or build everything from source."

- See http://finkproject.org for more information
  and to download a Mac OS X installer.

- Some Fink scripts use grep and don't work properly
  if grep is configured to color-code results.
  * do not do this
    export GREP_OPTIONS="--color=ALWAYS"

- To allow downloading new, "unstable" releases, modify /sw/etc/fink.conf
  so that the "Trees" property contains "unstable/main".
  For example,
  Trees: local/main unstable/main stable/main stable/crypto

- To update Fink, run
  fink selfupdate

- To install a package, run
  fink install {package-name}
  * examples include "ruby"
