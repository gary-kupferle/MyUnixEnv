These are the main git commands I think we will be using:

setup
  git config --global user.name "{your-username}"
  git config --global user.email "{your-email}"
  git config --global color.ui "auto"
  * these are saved in .gitconfig and can also be edited there

git clone ssh://{your-account}@{host}/{remote-repo-dir-path}
- ex. git clone ssh://{your-account}@141.102.95.154/~volkmarm/master/svcport
- can added an entry in Windows C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file
  for hostname (ex. dogstar) so it can be used instead of the IP address
- will create a local repo directory with
  the same name as the remote repo directory

git status = displays a list of files that have been locally modified, but not committed to your local repo

git add {file-path} = stages a file to be committed 
(only necessary for files that aren't already in the remote repo, but can be used to commit only a subset of modified files)

git diff {file-path} = displays differences between the potentially modified file and the newest version in your local repo

git diff rev1 rev2 {file-path} = displays differences between specific revisions of a given file

git commit -v = commits only "staged" files to your local repo 
(v option runs vi for entering a commit message and displays file diffs)

git commit -av = commits all locally modified files and staged files

git push = pushs changes committed in local repo to the shared remote repo

git pull = pulls changes from the shared remote repo to your local repo

git checkout {file-name} = revert working copy to latest local repo version

git revert {file-name} = revert local repo version to latest remote repo version
