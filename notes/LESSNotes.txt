LESS is a CSS tool like Sass and Stylus

http://lesscss.org

Issues
* LESS doesn't support conditional logic and looping.
  - Those are important for implementing certain kinds of mixins.
  - Stylus supports these.

To install
* npm install -g less

To compile .less files
* lessc {name}.less > {name}.less.css

To watch for changes and automatically compile
* npm install -g less-watch
* create ~/.less-watch containing "*.less:lessc {file} {file}.css"
* cd to directory containing .less files
* less-watch .
