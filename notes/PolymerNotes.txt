Polymer Notes

Issues
- Polymer properties declarations are just for documentation.
  * when violated, no error messages are generated
- lack of error messages when components are used incorrectly
- extra tags needed to embed CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
  in a single file make it verbose
- being a web standard doesn't guarantee success/adoption
  * for example, XHTML (replaced by HTML5),
    SOAP (typically replaced by REST),
    WSDL, XQuery, XForms, XLink, XPointer,
    many "Web Services" specs, ...
- no provided pattern for state management
- How can a Polymer component use functions defined in a
  separate .js file?  Can it use ES6 imports?
  Can webpack be used to create a bundle?
