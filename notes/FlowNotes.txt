Flow Notes

- overview
  * typechecker for JavaScript from Facebook
- to install
  * download
  * for use in Babel to strip type information
    - npm install babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types
    - add this line to .babelrc
      "plugins": ["transform-flow-strip-types"],
- to get help, run "flow --help"
- to get version of flow that is installed, run "flow version"
- to setup for a project
  * cd to project directory
  * run "flow init"
    - creates .flowconfig file
    - configure to ignore files under node_modules directory
      by adding this to [ignore] section
      .*/node_modules
      * why is the "*" needed?
- to enable checking in a file
  * add comment // @flow or /* @flow */ at top
- to run
  * run "flow" to start the flow server (optional)
    - makes it faster to check files because it only checks
      those that have been modified since the last check
  * run "flow check" everytime you want to check files again
  * run "flow stop" to stop the flow server (optional)
- to configure ESLint to strip type annotations before linting
  * npm install -g eslint-plugin-flowtype
    - from https://github.com/gcazaciuc/eslint-plugin-flowtype
  * modify .eslintrc (perhaps one in home directory) to include
    plugins: ["flowtype"]
