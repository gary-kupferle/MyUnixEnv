## Common Tasks

## Command-Line Arguments

Command-line arguments are held in a slice of strings stored in `os.Args`.
Index 0 holds the path to the executable.
An executable is created dynamically when "go run" is used.
Index 1 holds the first command-line-argument.
Often `os.Args[1:]` is used to obtain a slice
that only contains the command-line arguments.

For example, suppose the file `greet.go` contains the following:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  // Get a slice containing only the command-line arguments.
  args := os.Args[1:]

  // If the required number of arguments are not present ...
  if len(args) != 2 {
    fmt.Println("usage: greet {first-name} {last-name}")
    os.Exit(1)
  }

  firstName := args[0]
  lastName := args[1]
  fmt.Printf("Hello %s %s!\n", firstName, lastName)
}
```

To run this, enter `go run greet.go Mark Volkmann`.

To build an executable and run it,
enter `go build greet.go; ./greet Mark Volkmann`

## Flags

The `flags` package supports documenting and parsing
application command-line flags.
For example, here is a simple application that
outputs a range of integer values with a given prefix.

```go
package main

import (
  "flag"
  "fmt"
)

var minPtr = flag.Int("min", 1, "minimum value")
var maxPtr = flag.Int("max", 10, "maximum value")
var prefixPtr = flag.String("prefix", "", "prefix")

func main() {
  flag.Parse()
  prefix := *prefixPtr
  for i := *minPtr; i <= *maxPtr; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%s%d\n", prefix, i)
  }
}
```

To build this, enter `go build`.

To get help on the flags, enter `./flags --help` which outputs:

```text
Usage of ./flags:
  -max int
        maximum value (default 10)
  -min int
        minimum value (default 1)
  -prefix string
        prefix
```

To run this, enter of the following lines:

```text
./flag-demo -min 3 -max 5 -prefix foo
./flag-demo -min=3 -max=5 -prefix=foo
```

both of which output

```text
foo3
foo4
foo5
```

## Readers

The `io` package defines the `Reader` interface
that has a single method `Read`.
This populates a byte slice and returns the number of bytes read
or an error (io.EOF if end of stream is reached).

There are many implementations of this interface in the standard library,
including ones for reading from strings, files, and network connections.

To read from a string, see <https://tour.golang.org/methods/21>.

To read from a file, use the package `io/ioutil`
which defines a `ReadFile` function.

For example,

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  // Read entire file into a newly created byte array.
  bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile("haiku.txt")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  } else {
    fmt.Println(string(bytes))
  }
}
```

## Writers

The `io` package defines the `Writer` interface
that has a single method `Write`.
This writes a byte slice to an underlying data stream
and returns the number of bytes written or an error.
There are many implementations in the standard library
including ones for writing to strings, files, and network connections.

To write to a string, see TODO.

The package `io/ioutil` defines a `WriteFile` function.
Here is an example of code that writes to a file.

```go
package main

import (
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  data := []byte("Line #1\nLine #2")
  mode := os.FileMode(0644)
  err := ioutil.WriteFile("new-file.txt", data, mode)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

To write data a little at time,

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"
)

func check(e error) {
  if e != nil {
    log.Fatal(e)
  }
}

func writeLine(file *os.File, text string) {
  bytes, err := file.Write([]byte(text + "\n"))
  check(err)
  fmt.Printf("wrote %v bytes\n", bytes)
}

func main() {
  var (
    file *os.File
    err error
  )

  file, err = os.Create("out-file.txt")
  check(err)
  defer file.Close()

  writeLine(file, "Line #1")
  writeLine(file, "Line #2")
}
```

## JSON

The `encoding/json` standard library package
supports marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON.
Go arrays and slices are represented by JSON arrays.
Go structs and maps are represented by JSON objects.

The `encoding/xml` standard library package
provides similar functionality for XML.

To marshal data to JSON use the `json.Marshal` function.
This takes a Go value and returns a byte slice
that can be converted to a string with the `string` function.
Only exported struct fields are marshaled.
For example,

```go
import (
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

type Person struct {
  FirstName string
  LastName string
  Age int
}

func main() {
  p := Person{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann"}
  json1, err := json.Marshal(p)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Println(string(json1)) // {"FirstName":"Mark","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":0}
}
```

Some Go values cannot be marshaled to JSON. These include
maps with non-string keys, functions, and channels.
Pointers are marshaled as the values to which they point.
Cyclic data structures cannot be marshaled because
they cause `json.Marshal` to go into an infinite loop.

Here is an example of marshalling a slice of structs.

```go
people := []Person{
  Person{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann", Age: 57},
  Person{FirstName: "Tami", LastName: "Volkmann"},
}
json2, err := json.Marshal(people)
// skipping err check
fmt.Println(string(json2))
// [{"FirstName":"Mark","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":57},{"FirstName":"Tami","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":0}]
```

Each struct field definition can be followed by a "field tag"
which is a string containing metadata.
These provide information on how a field should processed in a specific context.

A field tag with a "json" key specifies processing
that should be performed by the `encoding/json` package.
This includes specifying an alternate name for a field
to be used in the JSON representation, and an option to
omit the field if its value is the zero value for its type.
For example,

```go
type Person2 struct {
  FirstName string `json:"name"`
  LastName  string `json:"surname"`
  Age       int    `json:"age,omitempty"`
}

p2 := Person2{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann"}
json3, err := json.Marshal(p2)
// skipping err check
fmt.Println(string(json3)) // {"name":"Mark","surname":"Volkmann"}
```

To unmarshal data from JSON use the `json.Unmarshal` function.
The first argument is a byte slice representing a JSON string.
The second argument is a pointer to a
struct, map, slice, or array to be populated.
Only exported struct fields are populated.
For example,

```go
var p3 Person
err = json.Unmarshal(json1, &p3)
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", p3) // {FirstName:Mark LastName:Volkmann Age:0}
```

Properties present in the JSON, but absent in a target struct are ignored.
This is determined by case-insensitive name matching.
This allows unmarshaling a selected subset of the JSON data.
For example,

```go
type PersonSubset struct {
  LastName string
}
var pSubset PersonSubset
err = json.Unmarshal(json1, &pSubset)
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", pSubset) // {LastName:Volkmann}
```

A JSON object can be unmarshaled into a Go map.
When the JSON property values have a variety of types,
it is useful to use a map with string keys and values of type `interface{}`
which can hold any kind of value.
Unmarshaling from JSON types to Go types are what would be expected
and include mapping JSON numbers to Go float64 values.

This approach can also be used to unmarshal arbitrary JSON objects
in a JSON array. For example,

```go
type MyMap map[string]interface{}
mySlice := []MyMap{}
err = json.Unmarshal(json2, &mySlice) // see value for json2 above
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("myMap = %+v\n", mySlice)
// [map[FirstName:Mark LastName:Volkmann Age:57] map[Age:0 FirstName:Tami LastName:Volkmann]]
```

The `encoding/json` package also provides the ability to
encode and decode streams of JSON data one object at a time.
This allows creation of JSON that is larger than will fit in memory.
It also allows processing JSON data as it is decoded
rather than waiting until the entire stream is decoded.

## Text Templates

Go text templates support creating complex strings by embedding "actions"
that are enclosed in double curly braces.
They are ideal for creating multi-line strings
that need embedded data.
Templates are supported by two standard library packages,
`text/template` and `html\template`.

Using templates is a multi-step process.

To create a template, call `template.New` which takes a template name
that can be used to embed the template inside other templates.
For example, `myTemplate := template.New("template name")`.

To add content to a template, call the `Parse` method on it.
For example, `myTemplate, err := myTemplate.Parse(content)`.

The steps to create a template and add content can be combined.
For example,

```go
myTemplate, err := template.New("template name").Parse(content)
```

If it is desired to avoid checking for errors and panic if there is one,
pass the result of calling `New` and `Parse` to `template.Must`.
For example,

```go
myTemplate := template.Must(template.New("template name").Parse(content))
```

To produce a string by applying a template to data in a struct or map,
call the `Execute` method on the template, passing it
a pointer to a `bytes.Buffer` and the data.
For example,

```go
var buf bytes.Buffer // implements the io.Writer interface
err = myTemplate.Execute(&buf, data)
```

To write the result of applying a template to data in a struct or map to stdout,
call the `Execute` method on the template, passing it `os.Stdout` and the data.
For example, `err = myTemplate.Execute(os.Stdout, data)`.

Template actions can set variables, conditionally include content, loop over data,
and indicate whether whitespace should be trimmed.

To set a variable, `{{$name := value}}`.

To conditionally include content,

```go
{{if pipeline}}
  true-content
{{else}}
  false-content
{{end}}
```

To loop over data,

```go
{{range pipeline}}
  content
{{end}}
```

To trim preceding whitespace, begin an action with `{{-`.
To trim following whitespace, end an action with `- }}`.

Let's look a full example.
Given data describing a person and their favorite colors
we want to produce output like the following:

```text
The favorite colors of Mark Volkmann are
  yellow
  orange
  red
```

Here is code to do this:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "text/template"
)

// Person describes a person.
type Person struct {
  FirstName string
  LastName  string
  Colors    []string
}

func main() {
  person := Person{
    FirstName: "Mark",
    LastName:  "Volkmann",
    Colors:    []string{"yellow", "orange", "red"},
  }

  content := `The favorite colors of{{" "}}
{{- .FirstName}} {{.LastName}} are
{{- range .Colors}}
  {{.}}{{end}}`

  myTemplate := template.Must(template.New("my template").Parse(content))

  err = myTemplate.Execute(os.Stdout, person)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
  }
}
```

Using `html/template` package has the same API as the `text/template` package,
but adds escaping of strings to avoid injection attacks.

TODO: FINISH THIS!

## HTTP Servers

HTTP servers can be implemented using the standard library package `net/http`.
There are also many community packages that make this easier and add many features.
A popular example is the `httprouter` package at <https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter>.

The following sections provide examples of implementing an HTTP REST server
using `net\http` and `httprouter`.

### REST Server Using Standard Library

The net/http package in the standard library can be used to implement REST services.
Here is an example of a simple HTTP server in a file named `main.go`.
To run it, enter `go run main.go` and browse localhost:1234.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

type myHandler struct{}

func (handler myHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
}

func main() {
  var handler myHandler
  http.ListenAndServe("localhost:1234", handler)
}
```

The `net/http` package can also be used to
send an HTTP request and receive the HTTP response.
For example, here is an application that uses an iTunes REST service
to get a list of albums by a given artist.
For more details on this service, see
<https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#lookup>.

```go
package main

import (
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  "sort"
  "strings"
  "time"
)

// Album describes a single album.
// This will be used by json.Unmarshall which
// requires all the fields to be exported (uppercase).
// It matches JSON property names to these case-insensitive.
type Album struct {
  ArtistID         int
  CollectionID     int
  ArtistName       string
  CollectionName   string
  ReleaseDate      string
  PrimaryGenreName string
}

// Albums describes a collection of albums.
// This will also be used by json.Unmarshall.
type Albums struct {
  ResultCount int
  Results     []Album
}

func check(err error) {
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  // An artist name must be supplied as a command-line argument.
  if len(os.Args) < 2 {
    log.Fatal("usage: albums {artist}")
  }

  // Form the artist name from all the command-line arguments.
  artist := strings.Join(os.Args[1:], " ")
  urlPrefix := "https://itunes.apple.com/search?term="
  getURL := urlPrefix + strings.Replace(artist, " ", "+", -1) + "&entity=album"

  // Get all the albums by the artist.
  resp, err := http.Get(getURL)
  check(err)
  defer resp.Body.Close()

  // Read the entire response body into a slice of bytes.
  body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
  check(err)
  //fmt.Println("body =", string(body))

  // Parse the bytes as JSON.
  // Using json.Unmarshall is preferred over json.NewDecoder
  // for JSON in HTTP response bodies.  JSON properties that
  // don't match a field in the struct being populated are ignored.
  var albums Albums
  err = json.Unmarshal(body, &albums)
  check(err)
  //fmt.Printf("albums = %+v\n", albums)

  // Sort albums by release date.
  results := albums.Results
  sort.Slice(results, func(i, j int) bool {
    return results[i].ReleaseDate < results[j].ReleaseDate
  })

  fmt.Println("Albums by " + artist)
  for _, album := range albums.Results {
    t, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, album.ReleaseDate)
    check(err)
    fmt.Printf("%s - %d/%d/%d\n", album.CollectionName, t.Month(), t.Day(), t.Year())
  }
}
```

### REST Server Using httprouter

```go
package main

import (
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "net/http"

  "github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter"
)

type any interface{}

func getImageURL(res http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  imageURL := "http://some-domain/some-image.jpg"
  sendText(res, imageURL)
}

func hello(res http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  fmt.Fprintf(res, "hello, %s!\n", params.ByName("name"))
}

// Can"t just omit the unused parameters.
func index(res http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request, _ httprouter.Params) {
  fmt.Fprint(res, "Welcome!\n")
}

func notFound(res http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(res, "Sorry, I could not find that.")
}

func postFindPerson(res http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  type person struct {
    Name string
    Age number
  }
  output := person{Name: "Mark", Age: 57}
  sendJSON(res, output)
}

func sendJSON(res http.ResponseWriter, obj any) {
  jsonData, err := json.Marshal(obj)
  if err != nil {
    msg := fmt.Sprintf("error marshaling %+v to JSON", obj)
    http.Error(res, msg, http.StatusBadRequest)
  } else {
    res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    res.Write(jsonData)
  }
}

func sendText(res http.ResponseWriter, text string) {
  res.Write([]byte(text))
}

func main() {
  router := httprouter.New()

  router.GET("/", index)
  router.GET("/hello/:name", hello)
  router.GET("/image/:id", getImageUrl)
  router.POST("/person", postFindPerson)

  // To get the file foo.html in the public directory,
  // browse localhost:8080/public/foo.html.
  router.ServeFiles("/public/*filepath", http.Dir("public"))
  router.NotFound = http.HandlerFunc(notFound)

  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```

## go-watcher

The go-watcher application starts another application in the current directory
watches all the `.go` files in and below current directory,
and restarts the app when any are modified.
It is ideal for working on servers such as HTTP servers.

`GOPATH` must be set to point to the directory
containing the `src` directory of the app.
To use this,
cd to the directory that contains the `.go` file containing
the application `main` function and enter `watcher`.
(This works in bash, but not in the Fish shell.)

It is also possible to specify command-line arguments
to be passed to the app.

For more information, see <https://github.com/canthefason/go-watcher>.

## SQL Databases

The standard library package `database/sql` defines
interfaces that are implemented by database-specific drivers.
This allows many databases to be accessed using the same API.

Database drivers can be installed using `go get`.
For MySQL, `go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`.
For PostgreSQL, `go get github.com/lib/pq`
For other databases, see <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers>.

For more detail on accessing databases from Go,
see <http://go-database-sql.org/>.

Here is an example of an application that uses a MySQL database.
It selects the `name` column for all rows in the `hero` table
and writes them to stdout.

```go
package main

import (
  "database/sql"
  "fmt"
  "log"

  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // anonymous import
)

func check(err error) {
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  db, err := sql.Open("mysql",
    "root:root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/tour_of_heroes")
  check(err)
  defer db.Close()

  rows, err := db.Query("select name from hero")
  check(err)
  defer rows.Close()

  var name string
  for rows.Next() {
    err := rows.Scan(&name)
    check(err)
    fmt.Println(name)
  }
  err = rows.Err()
  check(err)
}
```

## Calling other languages from Go

The `cgo` tool allows Go code to call C code.
For more detail, see <https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/>.

If needed, the C code can use the Java Native Interface (JNI)
to call Java code.

## Calling Go from other languages

The `gobind` tool generates language bindings
for calling Go functions from Java and Objective-C.

Go code can be built with the `-buildmode=c-shared` flag
to create a C shared library (in a shared object binary file)
that can be used by C, Java, Node, Python, and Ruby code.

For more detail see
<https://medium.com/learning-the-go-programming-language/calling-go-functions-from-other-languages-4c7d8bcc69bf>.

## Executing Shell Commands

Go can execute shell commands using the standard library package `os/exec`.
Note that this may not work in Windows
and does not work in "The Go Playground".

Executing a shell command in this way
does not create a system shell
and does not expand glob patterns.
To get this functionality,
use a command that starts a shell like `bash`.

The `Command` function takes a command name and arguments
and returns a struct describing the command.
This struct has many methods including:

- `Output`\
  runs a command, waits for it to complete, and returns a byte array
  containing everything the command writes to stdout
- `CombinedOutput`\
  runs a command, waits for it complete, and returns a byte array
  containing everything the command writes to stdout and stderr
- `Run`\
  runs a command, waits for it to complete,
  but doesn't capture what it writes to stdout or stderr
- `Start`\
  method runs a command, but doesn't wait for it to complete,
  and doesn't capture what it writes to stdout or stderr;
  use the methods `StdinPipe`, `StdoutPipe`, and `StderrPipe` with this
- `Wait`\
  wait for a command that was started with the `Start` method to complete

For example,

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os/exec"
)

func main() {
  date, err := exec.Command("date").Output()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("date = %s\n", date) // date = Fri Aug  3 13:32:22 CDT 2018
}
```
