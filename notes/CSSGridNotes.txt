CSS Grid Layout

To tell a container to use grid layout
- display: grid
- causes direct children to become "grid items"

To specify spacing between all cells
- grid-gap: 10px

To specify number of columns and size of each:
- grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 150px
  * three columns of varying sizes
  * using percentages doesn't work well
    because they don't consider grid-gap
  * "fr" (fractional) units do consider grid-gap
    - ex. 1fr to take all the remaining space
      after specified widths and gaps are accounted for
    - 1fr 2fr 1fr gives three columns
      where the free space is distributed between them
      using the numbers are weights
    - can use for column widths and row heights
  * value "auto"
    - means use maximum content size in a column or row
    - smaller elements are expanded to fit the cell size
  * value repeat(3, 150px)
    - creates three columns that are each 150px wide
  * rows are created automatically

To specify number of rows and size of each:
- grid-template-rows: 100px 200px 150px
  * if grid-template-columns is not specified,
    the number of columns defaults to 1
- if there are more items than will fit
  in the specified columns and rows,
  the specified row sizes will repeat to accomodate them
- to specify another size for any implicit rows, add
  grid-auto-rows: {some-height}
  * can specify multiple heights to cycle through

Extra items
- by default are placed on implicit rows
- to switch to use implicit columns,
  grid-auto-flow: column
  * defaults to row
  * similar to flexbox flex-direction
  * when this is set, can specify
    grid-auto-columns: {some-width}
    - can specify multiple widths to cycle through

Tracks
- columns and rows are also referred to as "tracks"
- ones specified by you are "explicit"
- ones not specified by you are "implicit"

Row heights
- default to largest content height in any cell in each row
- setting a height on the container changes this

repeat function
- instead of "20px 20px 20px", can write "repeat(3, 20px)"
- can use with any units (such as fr)
- repeat(2, 20px 40px) is the same as 20px 40px 20px 40px
- repeat can be used anywhere an individual size can be used

Spanning
- to make an item span multiple columns, add to CSS of item
  grid-column: span {n}
- to make an item span multiple rows, add to CSS of item
  grid-row: span {n}
