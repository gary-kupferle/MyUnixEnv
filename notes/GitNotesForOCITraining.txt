Git Notes For OCI Training

- To login to an OCI Linux box
  * open Terminal
  * enter "ssh volkmanm@ssh.ociweb.com"
    - logs me into the "hickory" box
  * ssh mosquito

- Setup
  * Git is installed in Mark Volkmann's home directory on mosquito
    (~volkmanm)
  * ~volkmann/master contains the Git master repos

- To create a new, empty, master Git repository
  * cd to directory where master repos will be kept
    - such as ~volkmanm/master on mosquito
  * create an empty directory for the repo
  * cd to that directory
  * enter "git init --bare --shared"

- To clone a Git repository
  * cd to the directory where the clone should reside
  * if not on an OCI Linux box
    - open an new terminal window
    - set up a tunnel to an OCI Linux box such as "mosquito"
      ssh -lvolkmanm -L9999:mosquito:22 ssh.ociweb.com
    - leave that terminal window open
    - open another terminal window

    - use localhost:9999 to acesss mosquito
  * enter a command like the following:
    git clone ssh://volkmanm@localhost:9999/~volkmanm/master/ESJA03-02-InterJava

- To add files to a local Git repository
  * add them below the clone repo directory
  * enter "git add {path}"
  * enter "git commit"

- To push changes committed in local repo to the master repo
  * enter "git push origin master" for the first push
    and just "git push" after that

- To prevent being prompted for password by every Git command
  * cd
  * ssh-keygen
  * cd .ssh
  * mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
  * chmod 700 authorized_keys
