CouchApp Notes

- To install
  * install Node.js (see node-jsNotes.txt)
  * install npm (see node-jsNotes.txt)
  * sudo npm install couchapp
    - adding " -g" to end made "couchapp push" fail

  * edit attachments/index.html
    - add content to body
  * edit attachments/layout.css to add CSS rules
  * create additional .js files in the attachments directory
    and add script tags for them to attachments/index.html
  * probably want to add the following to use jquery.couch.js
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery.couch.js">
    </script>
    - need to download the file

- To push app changes to CouchDB
  * create a file named "push"
  * chmod a+x push
  * edit push and add the following line
    couchapp push app.js http://localhost:5984/{name}
  * enter ./push every time any files below the project directory change

- Web app URL
  * http://localhost:5984/{name}/_design/{name}/index.html
    - can't omit /index.html

  * by default, CouchApps use Sammy, a small web framework
    - RESTful, evented, JavaScript
  * http://sammyjs.org/

- jQuery
  * currently CouchApps are given an old version of jQuery
    - get 1.4.4
    - can safely replace with a newer version
