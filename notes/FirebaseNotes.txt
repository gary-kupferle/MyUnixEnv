    - scales to accomodate the app
      * "Our servers manage millions of concurrent connections
        and billions of operations per month."
  * security
    - "All of your data is transferred over a secure SSL connection
      with a 2048-bit certificate."
    - "Database access and validation is controlled at a granular level
      using our flexible security rules language."
    - "We take care of provisioning the SSL cert for you.:"
  * offline support
    - "Your Firebase app will remain responsive regardless of network latency
      or Internet connectivity.  All writes to a Firebase database will trigger
      local events immediately, before any data has been written to the server.
      Once connectivity is re-established, the client will receive any changes
      it missed, synchronizing it with the current server state."
  * deployment
    - "Deploy using the Firebase command line tools and
      roll back to previous versions with one click."
    - "Every app gets its own firebaseapp.com domain,
      and paid apps can deploy to a custom domain."
