YouTube Notes

* Downloading local copies of YouTube videos
  - the URL of a YouTube video will end with a query parameter
    that looks like ?v={id}
  - use the id value to browse this URL
    http://www.youtube.com/v/{id}
  - you'll be redirected to another URL
  - look for ";t={t}" at the end of this new URL
  - to download the video in Flash Video (FLV) format, browse this URL
    http://www.youtube.com/get_video.php?video_id={id}&amp;t={t}

* Playing FLV files
  - the Mac applications "SWF & FLV Player" and "VLC" can play these
  - web browsers should play them with the following HTML tag
    but it doesn't seem to work in Safari or Firefox
    <object data="{name}.flv"
      type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
      width="425" height="355"/>
