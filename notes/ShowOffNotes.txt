    * port defaults to 9090, but can specify with -p option
* to view presentation
  - browse localhost:9090
  - in Chrome, press cmd-F to enter and exit full-screen mode
* sections
  - each presentation contains one or more sections
  - slides for each section are defined in a subdirectory
    with the same name as the section
  - sections are defined in the showoff.json file
  - to add a new section, manually edit showoff.json
* slides
  - slides in each section are defined in one or more MarkDown files (.md)
    * these files typically start with a two-digit number
      that defines their order
      - don't need to start with a number if
        only one MarkDown file is used for the section
  - each MarkDown file defines one or more slides
  - to add a slide to a section
    * showoff add -d {section-name}
  - to edit a slide, edit its MarkDown file
* to pickup changes to a presentation
  - refresh browser window
* to make bullets smaller on a slide
  - add "smbullets" instead of "bullets" to !SLIDE line
* to cause bullets to be revealed one at a time
  - add "incremental" to !SLIDE line
* to specify the transition to be used for entering a slide
  - add transition={name} to !SLIDE lines
  - not used when going backward through slides
  - there doesn't seem to be a way to
    set the default transition for all slides
* see examples in /Applications/showoff
