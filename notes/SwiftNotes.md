# Swift Notes

- Why are structs passed by value (copy)?
- Why can structs have methods just like classes?
- When would you use a struct instead of a class?
- if "let" is for defining constants
  and "var" is for defining variables,
  why is "let" used to define fields in a class
  that can be modified?
- class extension seems like a bad idea
- using {... in ...} to define an anonymous function seems weird
- guards seem weird
