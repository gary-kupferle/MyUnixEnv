Python Notes

Origin
- created in 1990 by Guido Van Rossum who now works at Google

One way
- tries to provide one way to do things rather than the
  "there is more than one way to do it" (TMTOWTDI pronounced Tim Toadie)
  approach of Perl and Ruby

Calling C and C++
- SWIG can be used to generate Python wrappers for C and C++ code

Versions
- The main implementation is CPython which is Python implemented in C.
- Jython is Python implemented in Java.
- IronPython is Python implemented for .NET.

Things I Hate
- self
  * Defining instance methods requires including self as the first parameter.
    ex. def set_cell(self, x, y, value):
  * Referring to an instance variable requires use of self.
    ex. self.cells[x-1][y-1] = value
  * Calling a method on the current object requires use of self.
    ex. while not self.solved():
- class attributes and methods
  * Are these supported?
- magic methods
  * I don't like the __name__ magic methods that get invoked automatically
    if they exist in a class.
    - constructors
      ex. def __init__(self, *cells):
    - to string
      ex. def __str__(self):
- encapsulation
  * attributes aren't declared
  * access to attributes is only controlled via convention.
