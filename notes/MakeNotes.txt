Make Notes

- a simple Makefile for compiling and running a C++ application

MY_LIB_DIR=some-path

run : Hello
	@ ./Hello

Hello : Hello.o
	g++ -o $@ $^

clean :
	@ rm -f *.o Hello *.stackdump

%.cpp : %.h
	@ touch $@

%.o : %.cpp
	g++ -c -o $@ -I$(MY_LIB_PATH) $<

- typical steps to build Unix-based software
  * generate .configure file by running "autoconf"
    (processes configure.ac or configure.in file)
  * generate Makefile by running "./configure"
  * compile and link code by running "make"
  * install the code in its intended location by running "make install"
    - typically need to be root to do this

- variables
  * can be defined near top of Makefile and referred to later
  * often used for directory paths
  * to define, NAME=value
  * to use, $(NAME)

- passing compiler flags
  make CCFLAGS="-D{flag-name}"
