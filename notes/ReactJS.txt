ReactJS Notes

- http://facebook.github.io/react/
- "a JavaScript library for building user interfaces"
- competes with AngularJS, EmberJS, and others
- claims to be faster than AngularJS due to use of a virtual DOM
  and using diffs to determine when the actual DOM requires updates
- does not use templates
- writing in pure JavaScript is ugly
- writing in the special JSX syntax is much better
  * combines JavaScript and HTML into one file
- emphasizes defining UI components that comprise a page
- each component has a render method
- add components to pages using custom elements
  whose names match the components
- no current linting tool understands JSX syntax
- only focuses on UI
- doesn't provide help with making Ajax calls
  or other non-UI tasks,
  so each ReactJS app can look very diferent
- doesn't have an equivalent for AngularJS filters
