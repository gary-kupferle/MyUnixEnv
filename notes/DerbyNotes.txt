Derby Notes

Overview
- Derby is a relational database implemented completely in Java.
- It can be used in two modes, embedded and client/server.
- In embedded mode only one local application can at a time can access it
  and no network access is allowed.
- In client/server mode, multiple applicaions can access it
  and they can do so remotely.

History
- work on Cloudscape database began in 1996
- Informix purchased Cloudscape in 1999
- IBM purchased Informix in 2001
- IBM donated Cloudscape to Apache in 2004
- Apache renamed it to Derby

Download
- from http://db.apache.org/derby/

Install
- unzip and untar
- set the DERBY_HOME environment variable to point to it
- add $DERBY_HOME/bin to PATH
- verify proper installation by entering "sysinfo" at a shell prompt

---

Create a database in interactive mode
- enter "connect 'jdbc:derby:{database-name};create=true'";
- this creates a directory with the same name as the database
  under the current directory

Column names
- column names that are reserved words must be quoted
  * for example, "year"

Connect to a database in interactive mode
- enter "connect 'jdbc:derby:{database-name}[;url-attributes]';"

Database connection URLs
- jdbc:derby:{database-name}[;url-attributes]
- url attributes
  * to create the database if it doesn't already exist, specify "create=true"
  * for other attributes, see the "Derby Reference Manual" section titled
    "Setting attributes for the database connection URL"
    (docs/pdf/ref/refderby.pdf)

Delete database
- there is no command to do this
- just delete the directory that corresponds to the database

Interactive mode
- to start this mode, enter "ij" at a shell prompt
  * stands for "interactive Java"
- command recall doesn't work in this mode!
- all commands must be terminated with a semicolon
- to get help in this mode, enter "help;"
- commands not recognized by "ij" are treated as SQL-J commands
  and executed directly
- to exit, enter "exit;"

JDBC drivers
- in embedded mode, use org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
- in client/server mode, use org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver

List columns in a table
- describe {table-name};

List tables in a database
- connect to the database
- enter "show tables;"

Load JDBC driver
- in Java 5 code and below, execute
  'Class.forName("org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver");'
- in Java 6 code and above, the driver loads automatically

Run commands in a file
- from inside ij, enter "run 'filename';"
- from a shell prompt, enter "ij filename"
- haven't yet found a way to put comments in these files

Start database
- in embedded mode, loading the JDBC driver starts the database
- in client/server mode,
