- #2 - in an existing tiddler, enter the name of the tiddler
  either as a WikiWord (a mixed case word) or
  enclosed in double square brackets (for non-WikiWords)
  * for WikiWords, the first letter must be uppercase, no spaces,
    and at least two letters must be uppercase
  * click the tiddler name to open it
  * double click the content of the tiddler to edit it
  * a common place to add these is in the MainMenu tiddler

Editing an existing tiddler
- to edit the content of a tiddler, double-click any of its text
- when finished, click "done" in the upper-right corner of the tiddler
- line limit
  * the content of each tiddler is limited to 30 lines by default

    click "AdvancedOptions", and modify the value for
    "Maximum number of lines in a tiddler edit box"

Deleting a tiddler
- edit it and click the "delete" link

Saving changes
- click the "save changes" link on the right side
  * this creates a backup copy of the file with a timestamp in the name
    and then overwrite the original .html file

    to the original .html file

  * to disable it, click "options >>" on the right side
    and deselect the "SaveBackups" checkbox
  * with SaveBackups enabled (recommended), changes are also saved
    in a copy of the file with a timestamp in the name
  * at the end of an editing session with many saves,
    there will be many timestamped files

    returning to previous versions of the Wiki
  * delete them if not needed
- AutoSave option
  * this option is disabled by default
  * to enable it, click "options >>" on the right side
    and select the "AutoSave" checkbox

  with each on a separate line

Determining linkers
- to find which tiddlers link to the current one, click "references"
  in the upper right corner of the tiddler

Macros
- special tags surrounded by double angle brackets
  that provide special effects
- many are preinstalled
- others can be obtained from the web
- examples
  * <<today>> - inserts the date today
  * <<tag tag-name>> - when clicked, displays a popup menu
    containing links to all tiddlers with the given tag
  * <<tiddler tiddler-name>> - opens a given tiddler
    when the one containing this is opened
  * <<slider slider-name tiddler-name "pop-up text">> -
    creates a link that when clicked slides open the content of a given tiddler
    - when clicked again, slides it closed
  * tabbed pane
    <<tabs css-class-name
    "tab-1 text" "tab-1 popup text" tiddler-1-name
    "tab-2 text" "tab-2 popup text" tiddler-2-name
    ...
    "tab-n text" "tab-n popup text" tiddler-n-name
    >>
    The tiddler for each is only displayed if the corresponding tab is clicked.
    css-class-name is the name of a CSS class used for formatting the tabs.
    To use default formatting, just use "no-style".
    Quotes around tab text are only needed if it contains
    spaces or other special characters.
    Bullets in the tiddlers associated with tabs are disabled by default.
    To enable them, add the following to the StyleSheet tidder.
      .tabContents li {
        list-style: disc;
      }

      #sidebarTabs .tabContents li {
        list-style: none;
      }

- many options can be controlled by clicking the "options" link
  on the right side
- one option that is enabled by default is to
  hide editing features when the page is viewed over HTTP (not locally)
- color themes
