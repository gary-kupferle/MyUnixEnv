Old information

  and it's not moving, double-click it;
  otherwise click VSClient icon on left side of task bar
- press "Connect" button
- enter password from gold card
- open a Cygwin window
- telnet to barracuda by entering its alias
  because it has the latest version of the FCS Studio software
  and you have credentials on that box
- scLogin starts the scKeyAgent

VNC setup steps
- download TightVNC for Windows from http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html
- install TightVNC
- ssh to the target Linux box
  ex. ssh -lvolkmarm 141.102.95.154
  * for running from Boeing PC, see PuTTY instructions below
- to kill a running VNC server
  * find the process id by running
    ps -ef | grep Xvnc | grep volkmarm
  * kill {process-id}
- to start a new VNC server
  * enter "startvnc"
  * this is an alias in your .bashrc to
    vncserver -geometry 1280x1024 :19
- may need to enter a command to keep this terminal from timing out such as
  while true; do sleep 30; echo hi; done
  Does this stop "Boeing VSClient VPN" from being stopped due to inactivity?
- configuration is in ~/.vnc/xstartup
- start the VNC client by double-clicking
  the "TightVNC Viewer" desktop icon
  * for the VNC server, use dogstar.sim.ssd.bna.boeing.com:19
  * none of the radio buttons under "Connection profile"
    need to be selected
  * press the "Connect" button
  * see the "VNC Authentication" password in your
    Address Book entry for Boeing
- press the button with four arrows in the top toolbar
  to switch to full screen mode
- press ctrl-alt-shift-f to exit full screen mode of TightVNC Viewer
- to open a terminal window, select start menu...System Tools...Terminal
- can drag the Terminal icon to the task bar for easier startup
- to change default geometry of Terminal windows,
  right-click the Terminal icon and change "Command"
  (for example, "gnome-terminal --geometry 81x50")
- to exit VNC Viewer, click "X" in toolbar
- to reset password
  * kill VNC server
  * rm .vnc/passwd
  * restart VNC server

To FTP a file from a Boeing Linux server to your Mac
- ftp 128.225.63.140 (stingray)
- get filename
- quit
- mv filename //.psf/Parallels\ Shared\ Folder
- The file should now be in ~/Documents on your Mac.

Encrypted email
- To get a certificate for a Boeing person
  * browse
    http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/doingbiz/ldap_proxy/get_cert.html
  * in the "Email address" text box, enter their email address
  * under "Email Encryption Certificates From"
    select "Boeing Issued Certificates (Class 2)"
  * under "Select How to Load Certificates:"
    select "Cut-and-Paste Certficate(s)"
  * press "Get Certificate(s)"
  * certificate data will be displayed in the browser
  * select all the data including the first begin marker line
    and the last end marker line
  * paste this in a new text file with a file extension of .cer
  * double-click the .cer file
  * this will open Keychain Access and import the certificates
- Many boeing and SAIC employees send email with a "From" address
  that uses different case than the email address in their certificate.
- When replying to an email like this, in order to make the reply encrypted
  you need to correct the email address you're sending to
  to match the one in their certificate.
- To make this easier, enter both email addresses in your
  Mac Address Book application.

Getting a document from ACE
- Tim Gundy likes to put documents for us in an OCI folder.

  * click "Enter ProjectLink" in the left nav.
  * click the "Project" tab
  * click the "OCI" folder
  * click a document to open it

Software Development Folders (SDF)
- allows access to secure, shared folders from Windows
- quicker and easier to use than ACE
- to use
  * double-click "SOSCOE SDF Share.ica" icon on Windows desktop (in Parallels)
  * a splash dialog box titled "Citrix MetaFrame" will appear
  * click "OK" in the warning dialog
  * enter username and password (see AddressBook Boeing entry)
  * a Windows Explorer window will open to show the contents of \\warbird\sdf$

To get the "target architecture" of the current host
- TARGET_ARCH="$(uname -m)-$(lsb_release -is)-$(lsb_release -rs)-se"
- echo $TARGET_ARCH

Extra disk space
- when your home directory quota is exhausted
  you can use /fcs/c4isr/bvj519

Clearcase for BCTM
- from a Command Prompt, cd to D:\BCTM and enter the following:
  mountvobs
  cleartool startview mv_SOSSWA_Model
  cleartool catcs - to see the config. spec.
