- Threads
  * In order to use thread priorities under Linux,
    you must be root and
    the environment variable LD_ASSUME_KERNEL must be set to 2.4.1
  * Under Linux, thread ids and thread handles are the same.
  * Under Linux, thread handles for real-time threads are 5 digits
    and for non-real-time threads are 10 digits.
