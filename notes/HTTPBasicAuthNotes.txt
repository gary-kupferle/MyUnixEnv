HTTP Basic Auth Notes

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html

To create passwords and groups files:
- touch passwords
- touch groups

For each user:
- htpasswd -b passwords {username} {password}

For each group:
- add a line like the following to the groups file:
  {group-name}: {username-1} {username-2} ...

To configure, create .htaccess file with the following content:
AuthType Basic
AuthName "{login-prompt}"
AuthUserFile {path}/passwords
AuthGroupFile {path}/groups
Require user {space-separated-list-of-allowed-usernames}

The .htaccess file can be shared by all applications
or be specific to the files in a directory of a single web application.
When shared, place the file in the Apache conf directory?
Whenever the file is modified, restart the server.
When specific to a single web app. directory, place the file in that directory.
In this case, the server doesn't need to be restarted when changes are made.
