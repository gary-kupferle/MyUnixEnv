Steps to setup SSH under Linux
- open a terminal window
- approach #1
  - from home directory, run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b1024`
  - this creates a subdirectory named .ssh
  - email ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the OCI administrator
    and ask them to install it on the firewall
  - also look for instructions on the OCI Wiki
- approach #2
  - cd to home directory
  - to make a self-signed certificate with a passphrase,
    `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`
  - to make a self-signed certificate without a passphrase,
    `openssl req -x509 -newkey -nodes -new -x509 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`
