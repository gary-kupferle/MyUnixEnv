Ant Notes

Creating JAR files
- to create a JAR that contains files contained in other JARs,
  use the zipfileset subtask
  * this is especially useful for creating double-clickable JAR applications
  * see Programming/Languages/Java/Swing/DoubleClickableJarInJar
- example
    <jar manifest="manifest.mf"
      destfile="build/${ant.project.name}.jar">
      <fileset dir="build/classes" includes="**"/>
      <zipfileset src="${jcommon.jar}"/>
      <zipfileset src="${jfreechart.jar}"/>
    </jar>

Cygwin
- to use the exec task under Cygwin,
  try setting the os attribute to "Windows XP" as opposed to just "Windows"

Installing under Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core
- even if a new version of Ant is first in PATH, it will not be used
  because Red Hat and Fedora will use the version of Ant they came with
- to fix this,
  su - # switches to root user
  rpm -e ant ant-libs # deletes the Ant packages that came with the OS
  exit
  hash -r # forgets remembered paths so PATH will be searched again
