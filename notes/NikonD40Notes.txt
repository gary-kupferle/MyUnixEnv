Nikon D40 Notes

Aperture
- this specifies the size of the shutter opening
- depth of field (DOF) is the distance between
  the nearest and farthest objects that appear in focus
- smaller aperture values
  * provide a larger shutter opening
  * provide a smaller depth of field
  * typically result in a faster shutter speed
- larger aperture values
  * provide a smaller shutter opening
  * provide a larger depth of field
  * typically result in a slower shutter speed,
    so may require use of a tripod

Auto-focus
- in order for auto-focus to work,
  the "A | M" switch on the left side of the lens must be on "A"
- to use auto-focus:
  * point camera so the subject to be in focus is in the center
  * press the shoot button halfway down
  * reaim camera to compose the picture
  * press the shoot button the rest of the way down to take picture

Date and Time
- to set the time zone, date, date format and daylight savings time,
  go to the wrench menu and select "World time"

- pressing the flash button only pop up the flash
  when in one of the manual modes
- flash modes available from the info screen
  * modes available depend on the mode dial setting
  * bolt - always flash
  * bolt + eye - redeye reduction
  * bolt + slow - flash with slow shutter speed (for night scenes)
  * bolt + slow + eye - flash with slow shutter speed
    (for night scenes with people in foreground)
  * bold + "rear" - for motion in poor lighting

Menus
- to view menus, press the "MENU" button on the back-left
- to change the menu being displayed,
  press the left side of the navigation ring
  to move from a menu item to its menu,
  then press up or down on the navigation ring
- to select a menu item on the current menu,
  press right on the navigation ring to move from the menu to an item,
  press up or down on the navigation ring to choose an item,

- to change the number of menu items that are displayed,
  go to the wrench menu and select "CSM/Setup menu"
  * options are "Simple", "Full" and
    "My menu" (to create a custom menu of frequently used items)

Modes
- AUTO mode adjusts everything by itself
- P is program mode
  * what is this?
- S is shutter priority
  * you select a shutter speed
    - press the "info" button on the top-right
      or "magnify +" button on the back-lower-left
    - turn the command dial on the back-upper-right
    - changes to the shutter speed will appear on the screen
      with values from 1" up to 30"
  * the camera selects the aperture and other things
- A is aperture priority
  * you select a aperture speed
    - press the "info" button on the top-right
      or "magnify +" button on the back-lower-left
    - turn the command dial on the back-upper-right
    - changes to the aperture will appear on the screen
      with values from F4.5 up to F29
  * the camera selects the shutter speed and other things
  * this is good for controlling the depth of field
    which is the range of distances that are in focus
    - small aperture numbers make the shutter opening larger,
      decrease the amount of time the shutter must remain open,
      and increase the depth of field
    - large aperture numbers make the shutter opening smaller,
      increase the amount of time the shutter must remain open,
      and reduce the depth of field
      * using a tripod is recommended with small apertures
  * this mode is most often used with a telephoto lens to
    reduce the depth of field for a subject that is relatively far away
    - for example, taking a picture of a zoo animal
      so the cage between you and the animal disappears
- M is manual mode
  * you select all settings
- all other modes are for specific situations
  * the "sports" mode is good for outdoor action photos
    but not usually good for indoor photos
  * the "no flash" and "night portrait" modes
    typically require the use of a tripod
    because the shutter will remain open too long
    to manually hold the camera still
