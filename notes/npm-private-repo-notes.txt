Notes on using Artifactory private npm repo

Many of the details documented here came from
https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Npm+Repositories#NpmRepositories-LocalRepositories

To configure npm to use this repo instead of the default repo
- npm config set registry \
https://components-build.maritz.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-maritz-local

To configure authentication details
- curl -udeployer:deployer "https://components-build.maritz.com/artifactory/api/npm/auth"
  * may need to run this on a Linux or Mac
    and copy the output over to a Windows machine
- add the lines that outputs to .npmrc in home directory
  * for me in Windows this is C:\Users\volkmam

Example Node module
- create a directory for the module
- create the file index.js in this directory with the following content:
  module.exports = function (name) {
    console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
  };

To publish a Node module to the repo
- create a package.json file for the module
  * run "npm init" which will prompt for data it needs and create package.json
- add the following to package.json for the module:
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://components-build.maritz.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-maritz-local"
  },
- npm publish

To publish a new version of a Node module to the repo
- bump the version number in package.json
- npm publish

To see all the modules in the repo
- browse https://components-build.maritz.com/artifactory/simple/npm-maritz-local

Example app
- create a directory for the app
- create the file app.js in this directory with the following content:
  var greet = require('greet');
  greet('World');
- install the Node module from the repo
  * npm install {module-name}
- run the app
  * node app.js
